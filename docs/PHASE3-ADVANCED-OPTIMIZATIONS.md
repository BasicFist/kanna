# Phase 3 - Advanced Optimizations Roadmap

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: Post-Validation Enhancement Plan
**Goal**: Optimize production deployment beyond baseline 100% accuracy

---

## Overview

With Phase 3 validation achieving **100% accuracy**, we can now implement advanced optimizations to:
1. **Reduce processing time** (5.1h → 30 min = 10× speedup)
2. **Reduce LLM costs** ($0.46 → $0.05 = 91% reduction)
3. **Improve scalability** (142 papers → 1000+ papers)
4. **Enable real-time processing** (<5 sec per paper)

---

## Optimization 1: Parallel Processing ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Architecture

**Sequential Baseline** (Current):
```
Paper 1 → Layer 1 → Layer 2 → LLM → Done (2.1 min)
Paper 2 → Layer 1 → Layer 2 → LLM → Done (2.1 min)
...
Paper 142 → Layer 1 → Layer 2 → LLM → Done (2.1 min)
Total: 142 × 2.1 min = 298 min (5.0 hours)
```

**Parallel Optimized** (New):
```
Papers 1-10  → Layer 1+2 (parallel) → LLM (concurrent) → Done (2.1 min)
Papers 11-20 → Layer 1+2 (parallel) → LLM (concurrent) → Done (2.1 min)
...
Papers 141-142 → Layer 1+2 (parallel) → LLM (concurrent) → Done (2.1 min)
Total: 15 batches × 2.1 min = 32 min (0.5 hours)
```

### Performance Gains

| Stage | Sequential | Parallel (10 workers) | Speedup |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Layer 1 + 2 | 24 min | 2.4 min | **10×** |
| LLM corrections | 50 min | 5 min | **10×** |
| **Total** | **74 min** | **7.4 min** | **10×** |

**Note**: MinerU extraction (1.77h) remains sequential (GPU-bound, already extracted)

### Implementation

**Script**: `tools/scripts/phase3-parallel-deployment.py`

**Usage**:
```bash
cd ~/LAB/projects/KANNA
conda activate kanna

python tools/scripts/phase3-parallel-deployment.py \
  --corpus-dir literature/pdfs/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/ \
  --output-dir literature/pdfs/extractions-PRODUCTION-PARALLEL/ \
  --workers 10

# Expected: 142 papers in ~30 minutes (vs 5 hours sequential)
```

**Key Features**:
- Multiprocessing for CPU-bound Layer 1+2
- ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound LLM API calls
- Automatic error collection and reporting
- Progress monitoring per worker

---

## Optimization 2: Fine-Tuned Chemistry Model (Future)

### Motivation

**Current**: Use general-purpose Claude with chemistry prompts
- **Advantages**: 100% accuracy, no training required
- **Limitations**: $3/1M tokens, requires prompting overhead

**Proposed**: Fine-tune specialized chemistry LaTeX model
- **Advantages**: 10× cheaper ($0.30/1M tokens), 3× faster, no prompts needed
- **Limitations**: Requires training data (which we now have from validation)

### Training Data Generation

**From Phase 3 Validation**:
- 27 correction examples from Capps 1977 + diverse set
- 15 diverse error types (experimental, statistical, clinical, etc.)
- Confidence scores (0.70-0.95) for calibration

**Training Set Composition**:
```json
[
  {
    "input": "( 5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g } , 3 ~ \\mathrm { m L }",
    "context": "SPE cartridge specifications",
    "output": "( 5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g } , 3 ~ \\mathrm { m L } )",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "category": "experimental_data"
  },
  {
    "input": "( < 5 0 \\%",
    "context": "sampling percentage comparison",
    "output": "( < 5 0 \\% )",
    "confidence": 0.80,
    "category": "statistical"
  }
  // ... 25 more examples
]
```

### Fine-Tuning Strategy

**Model**: Mistral 7B or Llama 3 8B (chemistry-specialized)
**Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) - efficient fine-tuning
**Dataset**: 27 validated examples + synthetic augmentation (1000+ examples)
**Training**: 2-4 hours on single A100 GPU

**Expected Performance**:
- Accuracy: 98-100% (same as general model)
- Cost: $0.30/1M tokens (10× cheaper)
- Latency: 50ms per correction (3× faster)
- No prompting overhead (direct input → output)

### ROI Analysis

**Full Corpus (142 papers)**:
- Current cost: $0.46 (Claude with prompts)
- Fine-tuned cost: $0.05 (Mistral 7B inference)
- **Savings**: $0.41 per 142 papers (91% reduction)

**Scaling (10,000 papers)**:
- Current cost: $32.40 (Claude)
- Fine-tuned cost: $3.50 (Mistral)
- **Savings**: $28.90 per 10K papers (89% reduction)

**Break-even**: Fine-tuning cost ($200 GPU hours) / savings per run = **700 papers**
- KANNA has 142 papers → Not yet cost-effective
- Future corpora (1000+ papers) → **Highly cost-effective**

## Optimization 3: Rule-Based Enhancement (Immediate)

### Statistical & Clinical Prompt Categories

**Problem**: Rule-based system has 0-40% success on statistical/clinical papers
**Solution**: Add domain-specific detection patterns

**New Categories**:

#### Statistical Notation Detector
```python
def detect_statistical_error(formula: str, context: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Detect statistical notation requiring fixing."""

    patterns = [
        # Percentage comparisons
        r'\( [<>] \d+ \\%(?!\))',  # ( < 50% without closing
        r'\d+ \\% \]',              # 30.8% ] mismatched bracket

        # Parameter notation
        r'\( [A-Z] = \d+\.\d+ \\',  # ( E = 0.9 \ truncated

        # Count comparisons
        r'\( [<>] \d{3,}(?!\))',    # ( > 1500 without closing
    ]

    for pattern in patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, formula):
            return 'statistical'

    return None
```

#### Clinical Notation Detector
```python
def detect_clinical_error(formula: str, context: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Detect clinical trial notation requiring fixing."""

    patterns = [
        # Incidence rates
        r'\( \d+ / \d+ ,(?!\))',     # ( 1 / 12 , without closing

        # Subject percentages
        r'\d+\.\d+ \\% [\]\}]',      # 23.1% ] mismatched bracket

        # Sample sizes
        r'\( n = \d+(?!\))',         # ( n = 12 without closing
    ]

    for pattern in patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, formula):
            return 'clinical'

    return None
```

### Expected Impact

**Current Rule-Based Success**:
- Chemistry: 66.7% (15/27 papers)
- Statistical: 0% (0/6 Aizoaceae errors)
- Clinical: 40% (2/5 Nell errors)

**With Statistical + Clinical Detectors**:
- Chemistry: 66.7% (unchanged)
- Statistical: **60-80%** (4-5/6 errors caught)
- Clinical: **60-80%** (3-4/5 errors caught)

**Overall Improvement**:
- Current: 44.4% rule-based success (12/27 errors)
- Enhanced: **63-70%** rule-based success (17-19/27 errors)
- **LLM calls reduced**: 15 → 8-10 (40-47% reduction)

### Implementation Time

- Statistical detector: 20 minutes (5 patterns)
- Clinical detector: 20 minutes (3 patterns)
- Testing: 30 minutes (on Aizoaceae + Nell)
- **Total**: 70 minutes

**ROI**: 70 min investment → 40% LLM cost reduction forever

## Optimization 4: Batch LLM Processing (Immediate)

### Current Approach (Sequential)

```python
for error in errors:
    correction = llm_correct(error)  # API call per error
    apply_correction(correction)
```

**Latency**: 304 errors × 500ms = 152 seconds (2.5 min)
**Cost**: 304 × 500 tokens = 152K tokens = $0.46

### Optimized Approach (Batch)

```python
batch = errors[:100]  # Process 100 errors per batch
corrections = llm_correct_batch(batch)  # Single API call
for correction in corrections:
    apply_correction(correction)
```

**Latency**: 4 batches × 2 sec = 8 seconds
**Cost**: 4 × 50K tokens = 200K tokens = $0.60 (but with batching discount: $0.30)

**Performance**:
- **Latency**: 152s → 8s = **19× faster**
- **Cost**: $0.46 → $0.30 = **35% cheaper** (batching discount)
- **Throughput**: 2 errors/sec → 38 errors/sec = **19× improvement**

### Implementation

**MCP Sequential Tool Batching**:
```python
def batch_llm_corrections(errors: List[Dict], batch_size: int = 100) -> List[Dict]:
    """Process errors in batches using MCP Sequential tool."""

    corrections = []
    for i in range(0, len(errors), batch_size):
        batch = errors[i:i+batch_size]

        # Construct batch prompt
        batch_prompt = {
            "task": "Correct LaTeX chemistry formulas in batch",
            "errors": [
                {
                    "id": j,
                    "formula": error['formula'],
                    "context": error['context'],
                    "category": error['category']
                }
                for j, error in enumerate(batch)
            ],
            "output_format": "JSON array with corrections"
        }

        # Single API call for entire batch
        batch_result = mcp_sequential_tool(batch_prompt)
        corrections.extend(batch_result['corrections'])

    return corrections
```

**Benefits**:
- Amortize API overhead across 100 errors
- Reduce network latency (1 call vs 100 calls)
- Enable LLM to see patterns across errors
- Automatic batching discount (35% cheaper)

## Optimization 5: Active Learning Pipeline (Future)

### Concept

**Learn from corrections to improve rule-based system**

1. **Collect correction data** (from Phase 3 + production)
2. **Extract patterns** (regex, structural rules)
3. **Add to rule-based system** (Layer 2 enhancement)
4. **Reduce LLM dependency** (catch more errors early)

### Example Learning Cycle

**Iteration 1** (Current):
- Rule-based catches: 44.4% (12/27 errors)
- LLM catches: 55.6% (15/27 errors)

**Iteration 2** (After 142 papers):
- Collected: 304 error-correction pairs
- Learned patterns: 15 new rules (statistical, clinical, etc.)
- Rule-based catches: 63% (19/30 errors)
- LLM catches: 37% (11/30 errors)

**Iteration 3** (After 1000 papers):
- Collected: 2140 error-correction pairs
- Learned patterns: 50 new rules
- Rule-based catches: 80% (24/30 errors)
- LLM catches: 20% (6/30 errors)

### ROI Projection

**Full Corpus (142 papers)**:
- LLM calls: 304 errors
- Cost: $0.46

**After Active Learning** (Iteration 2):
- LLM calls: 112 errors (63% reduction)
- Cost: $0.17 (63% savings)

**After Extensive Learning** (Iteration 3, hypothetical 1000+ papers):
- LLM calls: 61 errors (80% reduction)
- Cost: $0.09 (80% savings)

---

## Optimization 6: Real-Time Processing (Future)

### Architecture: Streaming Pipeline

**Current** (Batch):
```
Extract 142 papers → Process all → Correct all → Done (5h)
```

**Streaming** (Real-time):
```
Paper arrives → Extract → Process → Correct → Available (<5 sec)
```

### Use Cases

1. **Interactive RAG ingestion**: Papers become queryable immediately after upload
2. **Continuous corpus updates**: New papers integrated in real-time
3. **On-demand extraction**: Process papers only when needed (lazy evaluation)

### Technology Stack

- **Queue**: RabbitMQ or Redis (paper submission queue)
- **Workers**: Celery (distributed task processing)
- **Cache**: Redis (formula validation cache)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana (performance tracking)

### Performance Targets

- **Latency**: <5 seconds per paper (extraction + processing)
- **Throughput**: 100 papers/hour (vs current 28 papers/hour)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (distributed workers)

---

## Optimization 7: Chemical Structure Validation (Future)

### Integration with PubChem API

**Validate chemical formulas against known structures**

**Example**:
```python
from rdkit import Chem
import requests

def validate_chemical_formula(formula: str) -> bool:
    """Validate chemical formula against PubChem database."""

    # Parse LaTeX to molecular formula
    molecular_formula = latex_to_molecular(formula)  # e.g., "C17H23NO3"

    # Query PubChem
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/formula/{molecular_formula}/JSON"
    )

    if response.status_code == 200:
        compounds = response.json()['PC_Compounds']
        return len(compounds) > 0  # Formula exists in PubChem
    else:
        return False  # Unknown formula (may be novel or error)
```

**Benefits**:
- **Automatic verification**: Catch extraction errors missed by LLM
- **False positive detection**: Flag impossible chemical formulas
- **Confidence boost**: Known formulas get confidence +0.05
- **Research insights**: Identify novel compounds not in PubChem

**Limitations**:
- Only works for chemical formulas (not statistical, clinical)
- Requires internet connection (API rate limits)
- Novel compounds may be falsely flagged
