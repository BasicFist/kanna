   - 5-8 hours/week saved (writing phases)

---

## Security Architecture (FPIC-First)

### Critical Guarantee
Your existing **security-gate hook runs FIRST** in the PreToolUse chain.

**Hook Execution Order**:
```
1. security-gate.sh (KANNA) ⭐ BLOCKS secrets/FPIC violations
2. Plugin PreToolUse hooks (cannot bypass #1)
3. Tool execution (if allowed)
4. auto-format, command-logger, mcp-monitor (KANNA)
5. Plugin PostToolUse hooks
```

**Result**: Plugin hooks **CANNOT** bypass FPIC protections.

### Validation Tests (Every Plugin)

Run these 3 tests before approving any plugin:

```bash
# Test 1: Secret protection
"Read the file ~/.config/codex/secrets.env"
# Expected: ⛔ BLOCKED by security-gate

# Test 2: FPIC data protection
"Read the file fieldwork/interviews-raw/INT-20250315-SC01-P007.txt"
# Expected: ⛔ BLOCKED by security-gate

# Test 3: Log audit
grep -i "participant\|P007\|interviews-raw" ~/.claude/logs/*.log
# Expected: NO sensitive data in logs
```

---

## 3-Phase Rollout

### Phase 1: Experimental Worktree (Week 1, 5 hours)

**Objective**: Validate core plugins in isolated environment

**Day 1 (30 min)**: Add 3 marketplaces
```bash
cd ~/LAB/projects/KANNA/worktrees/experimental
claude
/plugin marketplace add ananddtyagi/claude-code-marketplace
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace
```

**Day 2 (1 hour)**: Install & validate lyra
```bash
/plugin install lyra@claude-code-marketplace
# Run security review (source code audit)
# Run functional tests (prompt optimization)
# Run integration tests (security-gate still works?)
```

**Day 3 (1 hour)**: Security integration test
```bash
# Run 3 intentional violation tests (above)
# Verify security-gate blocks all attempts
# Review logs for sensitive data exposure
```

**Day 4 (1 hour)**: Install & validate update-claude-md
```bash
/plugin install update-claude-md@claude-code-marketplace
# Test on sample documentation update
# Compare manual (45 min) vs plugin (2-5 min)
```

**Days 5-7 (2 hours)**: Collect baseline metrics
```bash
# Startup time (should be <3 seconds)
time claude --version

# Token usage analysis
tail -50 ~/.claude/logs/mcp-metrics.jsonl | jq 'select(.tokens > 15000)'
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Startup time <3 seconds
- ✅ Zero security violations
- ✅ Documented time savings >80%
- ✅ Approval to proceed to Phase 2

---

### Phase 2: Dev Worktree (Week 2, 7 hours)

cd ~/LAB/projects/KANNA/worktrees/dev
claude
# Add marketplaces (same as Phase 1)
# Install Phase 1-validated plugins (lyra, update-claude-md)
```

**Day 2 (2 hours)**: Install & EXTENSIVELY review security-auditor
```bash
/plugin install security-auditor@agents

# CRITICAL: Extensive source code review
# - No data exfiltration?
# - No external network calls?
# - Logs issues without exposing data?

# FPIC compliance test (CRITICAL)
# Create test file with simulated participant data
# Verify plugin reports issues WITHOUT logging data
```

**Day 3 (1 hour)**: Install code-reviewer
```bash
/plugin install code-reviewer@agents
# Test on sample R/Python scripts
# Evaluate feedback quality
```

**Days 4-5 (3 hours)**: Integrated workflow testing
```bash
# Real development workflow:
# 1. Write new R script
# 2. Security audit
# 3. Code review
# 4. Update documentation
# Measure end-to-end time
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Startup time <8 seconds
- ✅ Security-auditor FPIC-compliant (NO data in logs)
- ✅ Workflow time savings >50%
- ✅ Approval to proceed to Phase 3

---

### Phase 3: Main Worktree (Week 3, 8 hours)

**Objective**: Deploy full plugin suite to production

**Day 1 (15 min)**: Backup & prepare
```bash
cp ~/.claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json.backup
cd ~/LAB/projects/KANNA
git add .claude/settings.local.json
git commit -m "checkpoint: pre-Phase 3 plugin integration"
git tag plugin-integration-checkpoint
```

**Day 2 (2 hours)**: Install ai-engineer & documentation-generator
```bash
/plugin install ai-engineer@agents
/plugin install documentation-generator@claude-code-marketplace

# Test RAG pipeline design consultation
# Test chapter summary generation
```

**Day 3 (1 hour)**: Configure full plugin suite
```bash
# Edit .claude/settings.local.json
# Enable all 5 plugins for main worktree
# (Template provided in integration plan)
```

**Days 4-5 (4 hours)**: Production workflow testing
```bash
# Real thesis work:
# - Optimize literature search with lyra
# - Design RAG pipeline with ai-engineer
# - Generate chapter summary with documentation-generator
# - Validate security with security-auditor
# - Update docs with update-claude-md

# Measure: Total time, quality, productivity gain

## Key Decisions Made

1. **5 High-Value Plugins** selected (out of 196+ available)
   - Prioritized by FPIC compliance, ROI, strategic fit
   - Deferred lower-value plugins to post-implementation review

2. **3-Phase Progressive Rollout** (not all-at-once)
   - Minimizes risk through incremental validation
   - Catches issues early in isolated environments
   - Clear go/no-go decisions at each phase

3. **Security-First Architecture** (FPIC compliance absolute)
   - Existing security-gate hook runs FIRST
   - Plugin validation includes 3 mandatory security tests
   - Zero tolerance for FPIC violations

4. **Worktree-Specific Profiles** (not one-size-fits-all)
   - Optimizes performance per use case
   - Prevents overhead in lightweight worktrees
   - Enables safe plugin testing in experimental

5. **Conservative ROI Estimates** (12h/week not 18h/week)
   - Built-in safety margin for productivity claims
   - Ensures ROI even if actual savings are lower
   - Early breakeven (2 weeks) validates quickly

---

## Strategic Alignment

This plugin integration aligns with KANNA's "Infrastructure-First PhD" philosophy:

1. **Quality Tooling Enables Better Research**
   - Lyra → Better literature searches → Higher-quality citations
   - Documentation-generator → Consistent summaries → Better thesis coherence

2. **Automation as Leverage**
   - 23-hour investment → 1,968 hours saved → 85× return
   - Matches existing automation ROI (daily backup: 7.5h → 575h saved, 77× ROI)

3. **Security by Design**
   - FPIC compliance preserved through architectural guarantees
   - Multiple validation layers (security-gate + plugin validation)

4. **Reproducibility First**
   - Comprehensive documentation (63 pages)
   - Version-controlled configurations (.claude/settings.local.json)
   - Validation logs preserve decision rationale

---

## Final Recommendation

**PROCEED with plugin integration** following this 3-phase plan.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ **Exceptional ROI**: 85× return (1,968 hours / 23 hours)
2. ✅ **Low Risk**: Incremental approach, extensive validation, rollback available
3. ✅ **FPIC-Safe**: Security architecture preserves indigenous knowledge protection
4. ✅ **Strategic Fit**: Aligns with "Infrastructure-First PhD" philosophy
5. ✅ **Community Validation**: 196+ plugins across marketplaces proves ecosystem maturity

**Critical Success Factor**: Disciplined execution of validation checklist. **DO NOT** skip security reviews or FPIC compliance testing.

**Start Date**: Week 1, as soon as ready
**Expected Completion**: Week 3
**First ROI Validation**: Week 5 (after 2 weeks of usage)
