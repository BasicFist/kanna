# The Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) Inhibitor Rolipram Decreases Ethanol Seeking and Consumption in Alcohol-preferring FawnHooded Rats

## Metadata

- **Authors**: Chronic administration of rolipram decreased ethanol consumption and preference in rats having continuous access to $5 \%$ ethanol. (A) Treatment schedule for chronic rolipram dosing experiment. Rolipram $\mathrm { ( 0 . 2 \ m g / k g }$ , s.c.) or NS was administered three times a day from day 4 to day 7, while data observed in day 1–3 and day 8–10 were set as normal and post-treatment baseline, respectively. Rolipram significantly decreased ethanol consumption (B) and preference (D) from the second treatment day to the third post-treatment day compared with NS control. Water consumption was significantly increased from the second treatment day till the first day after termination of rolipram treatment (C). Food consumption was decreased only during rolipram treatment (E). The values are expressed as mean consumption $\bf ( \mathrm { g / k g ) }$ of fluid or $\mathrm { f o o d } \pm \mathrm { S E M }$ (two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by student t-test). \*, $p < 0 . 0 5$ ; $^ { * * }$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ; $^ { \ast \ast \ast }$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ compared with NS $\mathrm { 0 \ m g / k g }$ rolipram); $\mathfrak { n } = 8$ .
