## Abstract

Article history: Received 1 August 2016 Revised 7 December 2016 Accepted 12 December 2016 Available online 18 December 2016 Keywords: Acrosanthes Ancestral area Divergence times Fruit-morphology Disjunctions Dispersal Phylogeny Tribulocarpus The Aizooideae is an early-diverging lineage within the Aizoaceae. It is most diverse in southern Africa, but also has endemic species in Australasia, Eurasia and South America. We derived a phylogenetic hypothesis from Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses of plastid DNA-sequences. We find that one of the seven genera, the fynbos-endemic Acrosanthes, does not belong to the Aizooideae, but is an ancient sister-lineage to the subfamilies Mesembryanthemoideae & Ruschioideae. Galenia and Plinthus are embedded inside Aizoon and Aizoanthemum is polyphyletic. The Namibian endemic Tetragonia schenckii is sister to Tribulocarpus of the Sesuvioideae. For the Aizooideae, we explored their possible age by means of relaxed Bayesian dating and used Bayesian Binary MCMC reconstruction of ancestral areas to investigate their area of origin. Early diversification occurred in southern Africa in the EoceneOligocene, with a split into a mainly African lineage and an Eurasian-Australasian-African-South American lineage. These subsequently radiated in the early Miocene. For Tetragonia, colonisation of Australasia via long-distance dispersal from Eurasia gave rise to the Australasian lineage from which there were subsequent dispersals to South America and Southern Africa. Despite the relatively old age of the Aizooideae, more than half the species have radiated since the Pleiocene, coinciding with the large and rapid diversification of the Ruschioideae. The lineage made up of Tetragonia schenckii & Tribulocarpus split from the remainder of the Sesuvioideae already in the mid Oligocene and its disjunct distribution between Namibia and north-east Africa may be the result of a previously wider distribution within an early Arid African flora. Our reconstruction of ancestral character-states indicates that the expanding keels giving rise to hygrochastic fruits originated only once, i.e. after the split of the Sesuvioideae from the remainder of the Aizoaceae and that they were subsequently lost many times. Variously winged and spiky fruits, adapted to dispersal by wind and animals, have evolved independently in the Aizooideae and the Sesuvioideae. There is then a greater diversity of dispersal systems in the earlier lineages than in the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae, where dispersal is mainly achieved by rain.
