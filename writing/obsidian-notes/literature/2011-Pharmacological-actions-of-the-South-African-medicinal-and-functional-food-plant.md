## Abstract

Article history: Received 1 March 2011 Received in revised form 14 June 2011 Accepted 11 July 2011 Available online 20 July 2011 Keywords: Mesembrine Mesembrenone Phosphodiesterase Serotonin transporter Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Anti-depressant Ethnopharmacological relevance: The South African plant Sceletium tortuosum has been known for centuries for a variety of traditional uses, and, more recently, as a possible source of anti-anxiety or anti-depressant effects. A standardised extract ZembrinÂ® was used to test for pharmacological activities that might be relevant to the ethnopharmacological uses, and three of the main alkaloids were also tested. Materials and methods: A standardised ethanolic extract was prepared from dried plant material, along with the purified alkaloids mesembrine, mesembrenone and mesembrenol. These were tested on a panel of receptors, enzymes and other drug targets, and for cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells. Results: The extract was a potent blocker in 5-HT transporter binding assays
