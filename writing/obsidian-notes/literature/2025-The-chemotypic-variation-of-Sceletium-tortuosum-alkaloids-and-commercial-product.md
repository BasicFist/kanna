## Abstract

Article history: Received 5 May 2012 Accepted 4 June 2012 Available online 7 July 2012 Keywords: Central nervous system Chemotype Mesembrine-type Phytochemical variation Sceletium tortuosum Commercial production and trade in Sceletium tortuosum and its products is on the rise due to an increase in consumer demand. Mesembrine-type alkaloids are the main active compounds responsible for the therapeutic properties of the plant. In this investigation, GCâ€“MS was used to evaluate the variability in the mesembrine-type alkaloid content of 151 specimens of S. tortuosum growing wild in 31 localities in the south-western region of South Africa. In addition, the variability of the mesembrine-type alkaloid content of eight commercial products was determined. The total alkaloid content of wild plant material was found to vary between 0.11 and
