## Abstract

Article history: Received 21 August 2015 Received in revised form 9 November 2015 Accepted 17 November 2015 Available online 23 November 2015 Keywords: Sceletium tortuosum Alkaloid Alternative medicine Depression Anxiolytic Stress Ethnopharmacological relevance: Extracts from and alkaloids contained in plants in the genus Sceletium have been reported to inhibit ligand binding to serotonin transporter. From this, the conclusion was made that Sceletium products act as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. However, other mechanisms which may similarly result in the anxiolytic or anti-depressant effect ascribed to Sceletium, such as monoamine release, have not been investigated. Aims of the study: The current study investigated simultaneously and at two consecutive time points, the effect of high-mesembrine Sceletium extract on both monoamine release and serotonin reuptake into both human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal neurons, as well as potential inhibitory effects on relevant enzyme activities. Materials and methods: Human astrocytes and mouse hippocampal cells were treated with citalopram or Sceletium extract for 15 and
