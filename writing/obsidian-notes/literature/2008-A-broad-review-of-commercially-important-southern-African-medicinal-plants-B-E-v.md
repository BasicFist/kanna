## Abstract

Aims of the study: Commercially important indigenous medicinal plants of southern Africa are reviewed in the context of fundamental knowledge about their ethnobotany, phylogeny, genetics, taxonomy, biochemistry, chemical variation, reproductive biology and horticulture. The aim is to explore the rapidly increasing number of scientific publications and to investigate the need for further research. Materials and methods: The Scopus (Elsevier) reference system was used to investigate trends in the number of scientific publications and patents in 38 medicinal plant species. Fifteen species of special commercial interest were chosen for more detailed reviews: Agathosma betulina, Aloe ferox, Artemisia afra, Aspalathus linearis, Cyclopia genistoides, Harpagophytum procumbens, Hoodia gordonii, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Lippia javanica, Mesembryanthemum tortuosum, Pelargonium sidoides, Siphonochilus aethiopicus, Sutherlandia frutescens, Warburgia salutaris and Xysmalobium undulatum. Results: In recent years there has been an upsurge in research and development of new medicinal products and new medicinal crops, as is shown by a rapid increase in the number of scientific publications and patents. Despite the fact that an estimated
