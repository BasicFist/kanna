Article history: Received 29 April 2016 Received in revised form 10 June 2016 Accepted 24 June 2016 Available online 9 July 2016 Edited by AR Ndhlala Keywords: Sceletium tortuosum Anti-HIV Radical scavenging Phytochemicals Crude extracts of commercially available Sceletium tortuosum (Aizoaceae) were investigated for in vitro anti-HIV and free radical scavenging activity for the first time. In addition, the chemical profile of S. tortuosum was determined using qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analysis. Crude extracts were prepared from dried plant parts of S. tortuosum. Ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from the plants were tested for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 enzymes; protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). S. tortuosum revealed the presence of anthraquinones, terpenes, polyphenols, anthocyanin, tannins, alkaloids, glycosides, carbohydrates and coumarins. The total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents were
