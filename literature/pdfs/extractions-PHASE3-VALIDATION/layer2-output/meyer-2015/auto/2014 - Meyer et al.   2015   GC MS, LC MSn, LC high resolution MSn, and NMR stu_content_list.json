        "text": "Abstract Mesembrine and mesembrenone are the main alkaloids of Sceletium tortuosum, a plant species that was used for sedation and analgesia by the KhoiSan, previously known as Hottentots, a tribe in South Africa. After fermentation, the obtained preparation called “Kanna” or “Kougoed” was used by chewing, smoking, or sniffing. Today, Kanna gains popularity by drug users as legal high. For monitoring such consumption, metabolism studies are mandatory because the metabolites are mostly the analytical targets, especially in urine. Therefore, the metabolism of both alkaloids was investigated in rat urine and pooled human liver preparations after several sample work-up procedures. As both alkaloids were not commercially available, they were isolated from plant material by Soxhlet extraction, and their identity confirmed by NMR. The metabolites were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to linear ion trap high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR$\\mathbf { M S } ^ { \\mathrm { n \\cdot } }$ ). Both alkaloids were $o$ - and $N$ -demethylated, dihydrated, and/or hydroxylated at different positions. The phenolic metabolites were partly excreted as glucuronides and/or sulfates. Most of the phase I metabolites identified in rat urine could be detected also in the human liver preparations. After a common user’s low dose application of mesembrine, mainly the $O$ - and $N$ demethyl-dihydro, hydroxy, and bis-demethyl-dihydro metabolites, and in case of mesembrenone only the $N .$ -demethyl and the $N .$ -demethyldihydro metabolite could be detected in rat urine using the authors’ standard urine screening approaches (SUSA) by GCMS or ${ \\mathrm { L C } } { \\mathrm { - M S } } ^ { \\mathrm { n } }$ . Thus, it should be possible to monitor a consumption of mesembrine and/or mesembrenone assuming similar pharmacokinetics in humans. ",

The plant family of Aizoaceae is mainly distributed in South Africa [2]. Besides the main alkaloids, several structurally similar compounds were described in literature, for example $\\Delta 7$ - mesembrenone, mesembranol, mesembrenol, tortuosamine, sceletium alkaloid A4, etc. [1–3]. Geographic and/or growing conditions, age of the plants, as well as the process of fermentation influence the alkaloid content and/or composition [4].

Different preparations, such as herbs, powders, capsules, and extracts were called “Kanna” or “Kougoed” and administered by chewing, smoking, or sniffing for sedation and analgesia [5]. The alkaloids were tested by Harvey et al. in receptor and enzyme binding studies as well as in cell assays [6]. An ethanolic extract showed strong inhibition of the 5-HT transporter $\\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 : }$ , $4 . 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ ) and of the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4; $\\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ , $8 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ ). These values were given in $\\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ as the extract contained a mixture of alkaloids. Further experiments elucidated that mesembrine had the lowest $\\mathrm { K } _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ value $( 1 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { \\ n M } )$ for the 5-HT transporter, whereas mesembrenone showed the strongest inhibition effects against PDE-4 $( \\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } , < 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { M } )$ . Further clinical trials and experiments in humans confirmed these finding with antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of the extract [7, 8]. Besides the medical use, Kanna preparations (e.g., herb, powder, capsules, extracts), available in so-called smart shops, are misused as legal highs [7, 8]. During the last decade, such legal highs gained popularity in the drug scene, and their detection in screening approaches represent a major challenge in clinical and forensic toxicology [9]. Urine screening is the most comprehensive approach, covering a broad range of (also low dosed) drugs with a longer detection window than blood, but mostly the metabolites are the analytical targets. Thus, the metabolism and the detectability of new drugs in urine have to be studied. ",

The reference standards were commercially not available and had to be isolated first from the plant material. In addition, the detectability of mesembrine, mesembrenone, and/or its metabolites should be assessed using the authors’ standard urine screening approaches (SUSA) by GC-MS [10–12] and LCMSn [13, 14].

An elimination of these lipids was important, because lipids, especially fatty acids, may interfere with the following isolation procedure because of their emulsifying properties, for example by phase separation in liquid–liquid extraction. Further gummy material from the plant was eliminated by the following liquid–liquid back extraction under acidic or alkaline pH conditions. Unfortunately, only the rather toxic chloroform allowed sufficient extraction [10]. However, these purification procedures resulted in a lower alkaloid yield, as well as better separation conditions by the following column chromatography. The advantage of the basic aluminum oxide compared with silica [20] was the absence of strong tailing effects of mesembrine and mesembrenone and acceptable separation conditions by column length of $3 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ . Subsequent conversion of the isolated oily bases in their hydrochlorides improved purity, handling of substances, and their solubility important for further experiments.

The chemical shifts were close to those of mesembrine, but the resonances for the pyrrolidine ring protons appeared remarkably shifted downfield. These were good arguments for the existence of protonated mesembrine, and the 2D NMR analysis supported this structure. Unfortunately, a comparison with literature data was not possible. Therefore, as a final proof, the hydrochloride was converted to the free base. Its NMR data were in good accordance with those of mesembrine [21].

It was obvious that under these conditions, both H-7 were undergoing a deuterium exchange. This could be explained as a consequence of a keto-enol tautomerism. The carbonyl C-6 is in rapid equilibrium with the enol tautomer $\\mathrm { C - 6 / C - 7 }$ , which contains a pair of doubly bonded carbon atoms adjacent to a hydroxyl group. In $\\mathrm { D } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ solution, a deuteron will be exchanged in the hydroxyl group. The interconversion of the keto-enol forms involves the movement of the deuterium atom to C-7.

        "text": "All GC-MS spectra of mesembrine and its metabolites are depicted in Fig. 1. If the position of the metabolic change in the molecule could not be determined, the resulting bond is indicated by a tilde. In case of the Sceletium alkaloids, Martin et al. elucidated the structures in detail by MS, HR-MS, labeling experiments, and analysis of metastable transitions [3]. These data were used for further structure elucidation of the resulting metabolites and derivatized structures. The mass spectrum of underivatized mesembrine (Fig. 1a) is characterized by the base peak at $m / z 2 1 8$ resulting of formation of an aryl conjugated pyrrolidinium ion $( m / z ~ 2 1 9 )$ after loss of a hydrogen, by the allyl iminium ion at $m / z ~ 7 0$ , and the pyrrolidinium ion at $m / z 9 6$ . Besides these main fragment ions (FI), further fragmentations were observed from the molecular ion (MI) and/or the FI: radical loss of methyl group and/or loss of hydrogen to give several less abundant FI. Due to keto-enol tautomerism, acetylation of the enol function could be observed (Fig. 1b) and led to the shifted MI at $m / z \\ 3 3 1$ . In contrast to the underivatized mesembrine (Fig. 1a) and mesembrenone (Fig. 2a) with strongly different mass spectra, the acetylated compounds (Figs. 1b and 2b) showed similar fragmentation with identical FI at m/z 58, 86, and 100 and FI at m/z 229, 231, 243, 245, 256, and 258 with two mass units $( - 2 \\mathrm { H } )$ less caused by the additional double bond in mesembrenone. The fragmentation was strongly dependent on the degree of saturation of the six member ring. In case of the dihydro metabolite of mesembrine (mesembranol), without any carbon double bond in the indole moiety, the mass spectrum was different (Fig. 1e) and showed, besides the loss of the acetyl group from MI to FI at $m / z \\ 2 9 0$ , a following radical loss of a methyl group and loss of hydrogen to FI at $m / z 2 7 4$ . Further explanation for FI at $m / z 2 7 4$ could be the loss of acetic acid from MI. Due to reduction of the keto group, FI at $m / z 2 5 8$ (Fig. 1b) was shifted by two mass units to FI at $m / z 2 6 0$ . In contrast to the unsaturated compounds, FI at $m / z ~ 7 0$ , 96, and 219, observed in the underivatized mesembrine spectrum, could also be detected in the dihydro metabolite spectrum. Radical loss of a methyl group from FI at m/z 219 led to FI at $m / z \\ 2 0 4$ . These results were consistent with the observations by Martin et al. [3]. The demethyl metabolite (Fig. 1,i) showed analogue fragmentation behavior: identical FI at m/z 58, 86, and 100 as well as FI at $m / z 2 1 7$ , 231, 244 ( $- 1 4 { \\mathrm u }$ in comparison to mesembrine). Besides the demethyl metabolite, three demethyl-dihydro metabolites with MI at $m / z \\ 3 6 1$ could be detected (Fig. 1d, h, j). Due to the saturated indole moiety, the fragmentation differed from the demethyl metabolite and correlated with the dihydro metabolite: loss of an acetyl group followed by hydrogen loss to FI at $m / z 3 1 8$ and a loss of acetic acid to FI at $m / z 3 0 2$ could be monitored. Further loss of the second acetyl group from FI at $m / z 3 0 2$ led to FI at $m / z 2 6 0$ . For these compounds, fragmentations took place with minor abundance differences. For differentiation of the possible $O .$ - and $N .$ -demethyl compounds, FI at $m / z \\ 1 6 3$ and 121 (Fig. 1h, j) indicated the $O$ -demethylation. Analogue fragmentation could be monitored for the bisdemethylated compounds (Fig. 1k, m, n): loss of acetyl group from MI at $m / z 3 8 9$ led to FI at $m / z 3 4 7$ , further loss of acetic acid to FI at $m / z 2 8 7$ and 245 (additional loss of hydrogen $m / z$ 244). Elimination of acetic acid led to FI at $m / z 3 3 0$ or radical loss of a methyl group to FI at $m / z \\ 3 7 4$ . A differentiation between O,O-bis- or O,N-bis-demethyl compounds were not possible because all compounds contained FI at $m / z \\ 1 6 3$ . In addition, two other compounds with MI at $m / z \\ 3 8 9$ , but with different fragmentation, were observed (Fig. 1f, g). Due to their fragmentation, hydroxy metabolites could be postulated: loss of an acetyl group led to FI at $m / z 3 4 6$ and loss of acetic acid to FI at $m / z \\ 3 3 0$ . Combined loss of an acetyl group and acetic acid was represented by FI at $m / z ~ 2 8 8$ . A dihydrohydroxy metabolite was detected after loss of water (Fig. 1c). In comparison to acetylated mesembrine or mesembrenone (Figs. 1b and 2b), FI at m/z 70, 96, and 100 were missing and different fragmentation behavior was observed: radical loss of the methyl group from MI at $m / z \\ 3 3 1$ led to the base peak at $m / z \\ 3 1 6$ and radical loss of methoxy group to FI at $m / z 3 0 0$ . Cleavage of the acetyl group followed by loss of H radical $( - 1 \\mathrm { u } )$ was observed from MI to FI at $m / z$ 289 to FI at $m / z$ 288 or from FI at $m / z$ 316 to FI at $m / z 2 7 4$ .

        "text": "All GC-MS spectra of mesembrenone and its metabolites are depicted in Fig. 2. The mass spectrum of mesembrenone (Fig. 2a) is characterized by MI at $m / z 2 8 7$ , base peak at $m / z$ 70, and the minor abundant aryl conjugated pyrrolidinium ion at $m / z \\ 2 1 9$ as described by Martin et al. [3]. As already discussed above, the acetylated spectrum (Fig. 2b) of mesembrenone showed nearly the same fragmentation as acetylated mesembrine (Fig. 1b). The spectrum of the dihydro-metabolite (mesembrenol, Fig. 2c) is characterized by the base peak at $m / z 7 0$ and FI at $m / z 2 8 8$ and 272 resulting from cleavage of acetyl group or acetic acid, respectively. The demethyl metabolite (Fig. 2l) showed analogue fragmentation behavior as mesembrenone: same FI at m/z 58, 86, 100, and FI at m/z 215, 229, 242, and 315 ( $- 1 4$ in comparison to mesembrenone). FI at $m / z 2 8 4$ resulted from radical loss of a methoxy group from FI at $m / z \\ 3 1 5$ . Besides the $O _ { \\ l }$ -demethyl metabolite, three demethyl-dihydro metabolites with MI at $m / z \\ 3 5 9$ could be detected (Fig. 2f, g, j). They were characterized by the loss of an acetyl group to FI at m/z 316. Loss of acetic acid to FI at $m / z ~ 3 0 0$ could only be monitored for one isomer (Fig. 2f). In the spectra of two demethylated isomers (Fig. 2f, g), FI at $m / z ~ 7 0$ occurred and indicated $O$ - demethylated compounds, whereas FI at m/z 56 (70–14 u) was unique for the $N .$ -demethylated metabolite (Fig. 2j). The characteristic FI at $m / z 2 1 9$ was shifted by $- 1 4 { \\mathrm u }$ in the monodemethylated compounds to FI at $m / z$ 205 [3] and after acetylation to FI at $m / z \\ 2 4 7$ . These two FI appeared also in the demethyl-hydroxy metabolite (Fig. 2e) with MI at $m / z 4 1 5$ and FI at $m / z 7 0$ , indicating that the hydroxylation took place in the six-membered ring of the indole moiety. The mono-hydroxy metabolites (Fig. 2h, i) were characterized by intense base peaks at $m / z ~ 7 0$ and only minor FI at $m / z \\ 3 4 4$ and 328, resulting from cleavage of an acetyl group or elimination of acetic acid, respectively. In case of the bis-demethyl-dihydro metabolite (Fig. 2k), elimination of the acetyl group to FI at $m / z \\ 3 4 5$ or of acetic acid to FI at $m / z \\ 3 2 8$ was observed. Combination of both fragmentations led to further FI at $m / z$ 302 and 285. Absence of FI at $m / z 7 0$ , the presence of FI at $m / z$ 56 and 257, and FI at m/z 200 (214 –14, in Fig. 2j) might be a hint of an O,N-bis-demethyl metabolite. The dihydro-hydroxy metabolite was detected after loss of water (Fig. 2d). As observed for the mesembrine metabolite (Fig. 1c), the same fragmentation could be detected: radical loss of a methyl group from MI at m/z 229 led to the base peak at $m / z \\ 3 1 4$ , radical loss of a methoxy group to FI at $m / z 2 9 8$ . Elimination of the acetyl group was observed from MI to FI at $m / z 2 8 6$ or from FI at $m / z 3 1 4$ to FI at m/z 272. ",

Due to keto-enol tautomerism, a cleavage of water $( - 1 8 . 0 1 1 0 \\mathrm { u } )$ to FI at $m / z \\ 2 7 2 . 1 6 3 8$ was observed. Elimination of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ or $\\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ could be detected in higher abundance without wideband (WB) activation. The elimination of the amine moiety $( - 3 1 . 0 4 2 2 \\mathrm { ~ u } )$ to FI at $m / z$ 259.1326 or in combination with neutral loss of water to FI at $m / z 2 4 1 . 1 2 2 2$ was typical for mesembrine and its metabolites. The base peak at FI m/z 232.1331 $( - 5 8 . 0 4 1 7 { \\mathrm { u } } )$ resulted from an additional cleavage of the six members ring of the indole moiety from PMI. After radical loss of a methoxy group $( - 3 1 . 0 1 8 4 \\mathrm { ~ u } )$ , FI at $m / z \\ 2 0 1 . 1 1 4 8$ could be observed. The structure of FI at $m / z 2 1 9 . 1 2 5 1$ could also confirm the observation of Martin et al. for the GC-MS EI spectra of mesembrine [3]. These FI as well as the PMI were changed according to the corresponding molecule modifications caused by the metabolizing enzymes (CYPs, alcohol dehydrogenases, glucuronyltransferases, sulfotransferases, etc.). The proposed $N .$ -oxide of mesembrine with the PMI at $m / z$ 306.1699 $( 2 9 0 . 1 7 5 0 \\substack { + 1 5 . 9 9 4 9 \\mathrm { u } } )$ eluted after mesembrine and therefore differed from possible hydroxy metabolites, which normally elutes earlier than the unchanged parent compound. It showed nearly the same mass spectrum (Fig. 3,2) as the parent compound with mostly identical FI but in with different abundances. Dihydro mesembrine (Fig. 3, 3) with a PMI at m/z 292.1907 could be proposed. According to the addition of two hydrogen atoms, several FI were shifted, for example ion at m/z 272.1638, 241.1222, 134.0964 to 274.1798, 243.1378, and 136.1120. Differentiation between FI at $m / z 2 5 9 . 1 5 6 9$ and 259.1326 observed for mesembrine highlighted the advantage of the HR device. Three demethyl metabolites (−14.0156) could be detected (Fig. 3, 4–6) and the FI at m/z 227.1066 ",
