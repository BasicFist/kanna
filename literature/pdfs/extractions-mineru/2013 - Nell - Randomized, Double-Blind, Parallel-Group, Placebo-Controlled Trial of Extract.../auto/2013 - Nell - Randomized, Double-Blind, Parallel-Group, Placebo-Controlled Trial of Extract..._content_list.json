Intoxication and euphoria have also been reported.13 This spectrum of uses for Sceletium tortuosum suggests a dose-response，whereby the lowest doses of active compounds are ingested at the food side of the spectrum of uses, higher doses at the botanical medicine part of the spectrum,and the highest doses at the intoxicating end of the spectrum.
