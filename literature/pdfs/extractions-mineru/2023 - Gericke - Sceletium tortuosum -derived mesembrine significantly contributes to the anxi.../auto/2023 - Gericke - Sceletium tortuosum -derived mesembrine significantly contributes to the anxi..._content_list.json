Therefore, simply targeting monoamine dysfunction no doubt underlies treatment failure in about two-thirds of the estimated 280 million depressed patients globally (Willner et al., 2013; Akil et al., 2018; World Health Organization，2Ol8a),and about half of the 374 million patients suffering from anxiety (Sartori and Singewald, 2O19; Forbes Health, 2023).Treatment strategies that target various mechanisms would thus prove beneficial in such cases.

In this model, treatment with reserpine -which depletes monoamine stores to induce depressive-like behaviour (decreased locomotor activity) (Wang et al., 2019) - may be superimposed to allow for comparative assessment of both anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of an experimental treatment using the same stimulus protocol. Such an approach may provide information on the efficacy of a single formulation and concentration,on both anxiety and depression.In the context of ethnomedicines,this model may provide valuable information on the relative risk:benefit profile of individual plant components relative to that of a complete plant formulation.

        "text": "To our knowledge,concentration conversion guidelines between human and zebrafish larval models do not exist.Therefore,to determine a potentially effective experimental concentration range for Zem, effective concentrations of Zem previously reported was converted to mass/extracellular fluid volume,given that zebrafish exposed to treatments via immersion readily absorb treatments via their gills and skin (Dubinska-Magiera et al., 2O16). Given the small size of zebrafish larvae, the assumption was made that treatment concentration in culture medium and extracellular fluid compartments would be near equal (i.e achieving $1 0 0 \\%$ bioavailability of treatment).Taking this approach,a proven anxiolytic acute concentration in humans $( 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } )$ (Reayetal., 2020） translated to $1 . 7 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ extracellular body fluid (extracellular body fluid compartment is approximately ${ } ^ { 1 4 \\ \\mathrm { L } , }$ ,ora third of the 42-L total body fluid volume (Mathew et al.,2Ol8).However,a much higher acute concentration $( 5 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g / k g }$ body mass）was required to achieve an anti-depressant effect in rodents (Gericke et al.，2021). Considering an extracellular fluid volume of $3 0 \\mathrm { m L } / 1 0 0 g$ rat body mass (Bianchi et al.,198l),this translated to a concentration of 555-670 $\\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { m L }$ in rats with body mass of $2 5 0 { - } 3 0 0 g$ ,which when adjusted for the faster metabolic rate of rats (Bianchi et al.,198l), translated to a human equivalent concentration range of approximately $9 0 { - } 1 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { ~ } \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ Although larval zebrafish metabolic rate is known to be significantly increased during larval development (Makky et al., 2Oo8), the units of measure employed in larval assessments are not reconcilable with those of human or rodent metabolic rate assessments,and so it was not possible to mathematically correct for species differences in metabolic rate.

Studies have shown that ZF adults and larvae are very sensitive to serotonergic compounds (Stewart et al., 20l3). Coetzee et al. (2016) also suggested that ST is a serotonin releasing agent. Thus,long-term immersion in high concentrations may increase serotoninto dangerous levels that can cause excitotoxicity and serotonin syndrome which presents as increased activity and rotation (seizure-like behaviour),followed by hypolocomotion or fatigue (Bachour et al.,2020; Banono et al., 2021; Suryanto et al., 2021). This corresponds with our findings using the highest concentration of Zem,as well as the highest concentrations of the alkaloids used by Maphanga and colleagues.We identified therapeutic activity at much lower concentrations,with adverse effects and toxicity presenting as initial hyperlocomotion and eventual hypolocomotion from $5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L } }$ and higher.The sustained basal and LDTT hypolocomotion after $^ { 2 0 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ treatment with $5 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L } }$ Zem indicates toxicity,while $1 2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { m L }$ Zem fully wore off after $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { h } ,$ and the reversibility of the effects indicates that this concentration was not toxic.This pattern may also be seen with the high concentrations used by Maphanga et al.

        "text": "This lack of response could be explained jointly by the mechanism of action of reserpine and the experimental design.Firstly,reserpine depletes VMAT-2 stores which drastically decreases monoamine availability in the synapses and neurons in the brain (Cheung and Parmar, 2022).Furthermore,monoamine reuptake via transporters like SERT is necessary for sustained release of monoamines from VMAT-2,as the vesicles reabsorb and store the monoamines following reuptake (Coetzee et al.,2O16). One can thus conclude that if there are no synaptic monoamines left due to lack of storage and release thereof by transport vesicles,the effect of SERT inhibitors (like escitalopram as well as Zem, mesembrenone,mesembrine) or VMAT-2 upregulators (like Zem and mesembrine) would be negligible - explaining the apparent lack of antidepressant-like effects of the alkaloids.It may also explain why some alkaloids - like mesembrenone, that also inhibit SERT (Krstenansky, 2017)- significantly attenuated locomotor activity.Secondly,we cannot exclude the possibility that the duration of the treatment with the test substances were too short,keeping in mind that it was only administered for an hour,compared to the 24-h treatment with the reserpine (acute treatment with reserpine is insufficient to induce the depressive-like behaviour in the larvae).Treating before or during reserpine exposure may have produced different results,although long-term immersion in the test substances may complicate interpretation of results due to potential toxicity,as discussed above.This limitation with the ZF larval model may thus warrant alternative investigations using other models, e.g.rodent models,to elucidate these mechanisms using a more translatable dosing regimen instead of long-term drug immersion.

Moreover, multimodal compounds, such as Zem, are attracting interest as psychotropics by targeting the heterogeneous aetiology of anxiety and mood disorders (Brand et al., 2O15).
