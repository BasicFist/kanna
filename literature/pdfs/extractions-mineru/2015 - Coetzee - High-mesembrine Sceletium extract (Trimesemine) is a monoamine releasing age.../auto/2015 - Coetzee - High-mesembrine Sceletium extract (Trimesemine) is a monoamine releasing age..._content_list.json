According to the same source, the plant's effect in humans was “weaker than that of cocaine”, but nevertheless resulted in a depression of the central nervous system, and not activation, as could be expected of a cocaine-like substance. Also of interest is that, unlike cocaine, consumption of the plant does not seem to cause addiction or hallucination (Van Wyk and Wink, 2009). ",

In terms of potential mechanism(s) of action, the complete extract was previously shown to effectively inhibit serotonin binding to the serotonin transporter, while some of the alkaloids contained in Sceletium were reported in the same paper to inhibit phosphodiesterase 4A activity (potency: mesembrenone $>$ mesembrine $>$ mesembrenol) (Harvey et al., 2011). From these limited data, it was concluded that Sceletium acts as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor. However, other mechanisms which may similarly result in the anxiolytic or antidepressant effect ascribed to Sceletium, such as monoamine release, have not been investigated. Also, since repeated administration of SSRIs has been linked to up-regulation of PDE4 and subsequent hyposensitivity to SSRIs (Ye et al., 2000), the report of decreased PDE4 activity with Sceletium administration seems to argue against it being a pure SSRI.

A mean of 77 cells per condition was assessed. Using ImageJ (v1.42q) software, mean fluorescent intensity was measured for SERT and VMAT-2 expression, with fluorescent intensity corrected for mean fluorescence of background for each field of view.

The data reported here points out the necessity of following up exploratory pharmacological studies with physiological testing before firm conclusions are made. The current study for the first time presents data to comprehensively describe the effects of an extract from Sceletium, simultaneously assessing parameters involved in both serotonin release and serotonin reuptake in two different cellular models and in comparison with a known pharmaceutical serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Citalopram). In addition, we present data on inhibitory capacity of the extract on two neurologically relevant enzymes, again using appropriate controls, in order to further elucidate the potential effects mediated by extracts prepared from Sceletium.

In comparison, relatively high concentrations of TRI were required to obtain an inhibitory effect on SERT expression, which seemed more moderate in magnitude when compared to that of Citalopram. In contrast, TRI showed a much more pronounced up-regulation of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT-2) expression when compared to Citalopram treatment-Citalopram resulted in a relatively moderate increase in VMAT-2 in the hippocampal cells only, with no effect in the astrocytes. VMAT-2 is known to play a role in not only monoamine release, but also storage (Fon et al., 1997). The upregulation of VMAT-2 in response to Citalopram seen in the GT1-7 cells therefore probably indicates monoamine storage, in line with its known pharmaceutical mechanism of action. In contrast, the higher level of up-regulated VMAT-2 expression in response to TRI, which occurs in both cell types assessed, suggest monoamine production and subsequent release. The fact that in astrocytes, for the highest dose of TRI, VMAT-2 up-regulation is evident at $1 5 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ , but lost at $3 0 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ , while for the lower doses up-regulation was sustained, supports the notion of release: since sustained monoamine release is dependent on monoamine reuptake via e.g. SERT, which would be limited due to the mild inhibition reported here for TRI on SERT expression, substrate depletion would lead to VMAT-2 down-regulation over time, as indeed seen at the $3 0 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ time point for the highest dose of TRI. The relatively higher variation at this time point for the $0 . 1 ~ \\mathrm { m g / m l }$ dose, which is evident from the error bars in Fig. 4b further supports this interpretation. (The fact that this phenomenon was not observed in GT1-7 cells is probably due to the fact that hippocampal cells are more equipped for de novo serotonin production than astrocytes – as is evident from the relatively higher VMAT-2 response when compared to astrocytes – thus, the GT1-7 cells were less dependent on serotonin recycled via reuptake in this model.) An in vivo model could be employed in a follow-on study to provide more definitive data on these timedependent effects. Also, assessment of different monoamines in such a model could provide information on specific monoamines implicated here. ",

Interestingly, the addictive (award) effect of cocaine is linked to its dual inhibition of both SERT and dopamine transporter (DAT)(Torres et al., 2003), a mechanism also linked to the withdrawal symptoms suffered after cocaine or alcohol abuse (Rothman et al., 2008). Recently, a pharmacological study on another Sceletium extract, as well as the key alkaloids mesembrine, mesembrenone and mesembrenol, has reported no significant inhibition of dopamine transporters (Harvey et al., 2011). Thus, these data together suggest that high-mesembrine Sceletium products may have potential for development as therapeutic adjuncts for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Staying with the therapeutic context, the ability of TRI to up-regulate VMAT-2 may also indicate potential for modulation of other disorders that involve neuronal dopamine abnormalities, such as Parkinson's disease, since modulation of VMAT-2 has been named as therapeutic target in the context of not only cocaine and alcohol addiction, but also Parkinson's disease (Brown et al., 2001).

        "text": "Of specific interest in the context of high-mesembrine Sceletium showing potential as monoamine releasing agent, is the fact that the high-mesembrine extract showed only a mild inhibition of monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) activity. MAO-A plays an important role in metabolism of intracellular neurotransmitters in the context of especially depression, and MAO-A inhibition – which results in less intracellular monoamine breakdown – has been shown effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as depression, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Pathak et al., 2015). However, excessive downregulation of MAOA by methamphetamine has been linked to chronic pulmonary toxicity in rats (Wang et al., 2013) and the use of MAO inhibitors in conjunction with monoamine releasing agents such as MDMA, have led to mortalities (Rietjens et al., 2012; Smilkstein et al., 1987), so that the low level inhibition reported here, is probably a desired outcome. Interestingly, MAO inhibitors are known to inhibit the P450 enzymes, which is in accordance with our recent report of targeted inhibition of specific P450 enzymes by highdose TRI, in the context of steroid synthesis (Swart and Smith, manuscript under review). Interestingly, in the latter study, TRI also alleviated forskolin- and angiotensin II-induced aldosterone synthesis, suggesting an anti-hypertension effect – but at high dose only, which further supports the notion of only mild MAO-A inhibition. This relatively mild inhibition of MAO-A by the extract used in the current study, may suggest that the extract will not cause cytotoxicity even at large doses, which may be important if employed as counter-medication in addiction.

        "text": "As for MAO-A, our data indicates a rather mild inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by TRI. This is in line with a previous report on Sceletium extract (Lubbe et al., 2010), in which $1 \\mathrm { m g / m l }$ of pure mesembrine achieved only a $\\approx 3 0 \\%$ AChE inhibition, while the complete alkaloid extract from Sceletium tortuosum inhibited AChE in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest concentration assessed $( 1 ~ \\mathrm { m g / m l } )$ resulting in $8 7 \\%$ inhibition, which suggests that the non-mesembrine portion of Sceletium may be responsible for the plant’s inhibitory effects on AChE activity. Somewhat surprisingly, a whole extract with low mesembrine content was reported to only inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity by $7 \\%$ (Harvey et al., 2011). This contrasts the finding by Lubbe and colleagues. However, Harvey et al. employed a different methodology to the Ellman’s test and much lower doses of both extract and alkaloids, which may have been too low to achieve therapeutic effect in this context. Combined, these results indicate that the indigenous use of Sceletium, which entails chewing of the plant material, may well have an inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase activity – while the extract manipulated to achieve high mesembrine content, have lost this inhibitory capacity to some extent. This may be the result of a loss of potentiation by other minor alkaloids in the plant, as indeed suggested by Lubbe and colleagues. ",

        "text": "Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity would result in increased acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the central nervous system. ACh has been named as essential to promote REM sleep (Platt and Riedel, 2011) and sustained attention (Himmelheber et al., 2000), while ACh disruption (increased signalling) is thought to be a primary cause of anxiety and depression (Higley and Picciotto, 2014), as well as the memory, learning and attention deficits seen in Alzheimer’s disease (in the case of decreased signalling) (Ge and Dani, 2005). AChE inhibition has therefore been a therapeutic focus, also in the natural medicine arena, where a number of AChE have been identified (Ahmed et al., 2013). Therefore, this potential benefit of maintaining ACh function that is locked into Sceletium components warrants more specific investigations in this context, to elucidate not only the major alkaloid contributor, but also potentiating effects of other plant constituents. Combined, available data suggest that for treatment of an anxious population, it is probably a benefit that TRI is only mildly inhibitory of AChE. Furthermore, the Sceletium plant should be developed further, especially in terms of its non-mesembrine fraction, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other memory or attention deficit disorders. As is, the extract could already be beneficial as complimentary supplement in these specific conditions, although interaction effects with traditional pharmaceutical treatments should then be elucidated to ensure safety of use.
