Indigenous, traditional, and local knowledge about nature is disappearing even more rapidly than is biodiversity itself. Once lost, such knowledge, with its unique insights into nature, can never be regained. Plant scientists must work together with holders of this knowledge to understand and achieve sustainable environmental stewardship. Cultural diversity, coupled to crop genetic diversity, will be of central importance for future food security. We will need informed collaboration coupled with urgent, rigorous planning and implementation across cultures and knowledge systems.” ",

It is also clear that the oral–traditional culture of Africa has left a rich legacy of indigenous knowledge that has yet to be systematically recorded, let alone analysed. The large number of African scientists that have contributed to this Special Edition indicates that a new era has already dawned, in which local research capacity is rapidly developing. As more and more data become available, a much clearer picture is starting to emerge of the depth of knowledge that resides in Africa. It is becoming evident that there is a great urgency to record ancient knowledge and wisdom before it becomes lost to future generations. We hope that the diversity of ethnobotanical papers presented here will be useful to many scientists and that especially young African researchers will be inspired to record and analyse the fascinating and complicated human– plant interactions of the African continent, which all of humanity once called home.
