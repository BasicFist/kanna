Linear discriminant analysis confirmed these similarities and demonstrated that all three dosages of Zembrins plotted in close neighbourhood to each other. Citocoline, a synthetic compound originally developed for cognitive enhancement, had a similar electropharmacogram to Zembrins. Similarity to the electropharmacograms of the synthetic phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram, suggests Zembrins has antidepressant and cognitive function enhancing potential. ",

The acute effects of Extract Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrins) administration in 16 healthy young adults was studied in a pharmaco-fMRI study focused on anxiety-related activity in the amygdala and its connected neurocircuitry. Amygdala reactivity to fearful faces under low perceptual load conditions was attenuated after a single $2 5 . 0 \\mathrm { m g }$ dose of Zembrins. Follow-up connectivity analysis on the emotion matching task demonstrated that amygdala–hypothalamus coupling was also reduced. These results demonstrated for the first time the attenuating effects of Sceletium tortuosum on the threat circuitry of the human brain and provide supporting evidence that the dual 5-HT reuptake inhibition and PDE4 inhibition of Zembrins might have anxiolytic potential by attenuating the subcortical threat response (Terburg et al., 2013).

Since the electric activity of single neurons depends on the set of momentarily active ion channels, communication between neurons is governed by channel activity.

The relationship between EEG delta waves and cholinergic neurotransmission was first recognised in 2005 (Dimpfel, 2005), while it was recognized that theta waves are influenced by drugs acting at the biochemically defined norepinephrine alpha2 receptor (Dimpfel and Schober, 2001). Presynaptic interaction with this receptor leads to drowsiness and sleep, and increases of theta waves have been used as part of a formula describing depth of sleep in humans.

In short, after automatic artefact rejection signals were collected in sweeps of $4 s$ duration and Fast Fourier transformed using a Hanning window. Sampling frequency was $5 1 2 \\mathrm { H z }$ . Four values were averaged to give a final sampling frequency of $1 2 8 \\ : \\mathrm { H z }$ , well above the Nyquist frequency. The resulting electrical power spectra were divided into 6 specially defined frequency ranges (delta: $1 . 5 0 { - } 4 . 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ ; theta: $4 . 2 5 { - } 6 . 7 5 \\mathrm { H z }$ ; alpha1: $7 . 0 0 { - } 9 . 5 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ ; alpha2: $9 . 7 5 \\substack { - 1 2 . 2 5 \\mathrm { H z } }$ ; beta1a: $1 2 . 5 0 { - } 1 5 . 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ ; beta1b: $1 5 . 2 5 \\mathrm { - } 1 7 . 7 5 \\mathrm { H z }$ ; beta2: $1 8 . 0 0 -$ $3 4 . 2 5 \\ : \\mathrm { H z }$ ; gamma: $3 4 . 5 0 { - } 8 1 . 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ ). Spectra were averaged in steps of 3 min each and displayed on-line. In an off-line procedure spectra were averaged to give longer periods for further analysis and data presentation. ",

Firstly, projection of the results from reference compounds plus physiological sleep was performed using the three spatial coordinates for the first three discriminant-axes. Secondly, coding of the result of the fourth to sixth discriminant analysis into red, green and blue was followed by an additive colour mixture in analogy to the so-called RGB mode (as used in TV).

Based on numerous experimental results it has been concluded that preparations inducing a similar pattern of changes of spectral power have similar clinical therapeutic indications (Dimpfel, 2003). Zembrins dose dependently induced attenuation of all frequency ranges to a varying degree. The most prominent was the statistically significant reduction in alpha2 and beta1a waves, correlated with activation of the dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmitter systems respectively. This feature is common to all synthetic and herbal stimulants tested to date. The second strongest effects were reduction in both the delta and the theta frequency ranges, correlated with changes in the cholinergic and norepinephrine systems respectively, a pattern seen in preparations prescribed for neurodegenerative diseases. Theta wave reduction in common with the delta, alpha2 and beta1 attenuation has been noted for analgesic drugs. Attenuation of alpha1 waves emerged during the highest dosage in all brain areas, a feature seen in all antidepressants. The dose dependent increase of gamma activity has been clearly related to motion in a previous publication (Dimpfel and Schombert, 2015), however no conclusions could be made as direct measurement of motion resulted in too high variability, while gamma activity had already appeared simply with the first motion of the head.

With respect to botanicals or herbal preparations a special extract of Oenothera biennis containing $5 0 \\%$ polyphenols was recognized as the most similar herbal preparation to the middle dosage of Zembrins. Extracts of Cimicifuga racemosa and Ginkgo biloba showed a quite similar profile of changes to those for Zembrin. The electropharmacogram for Ginkgo biloba extract was similar to that for Zembrins, with the difference consisting of attenuation of alpha1 spectral power in Ginkgo, an effect not apparent in the profile for Zembrins at lower doses. A close similarity to the action of Zembrins was also observed for an extract of Rhodiola rosea. Rhodiola has been classified as a so-called adaptogenic botanical, which helps one cope with physical and emotional stress. The clinical efficacy of a Rhodiola rosea extract has been recently characterized using a combination of fast dynamic EEG analysis (Neurocode-Tracking) in combination with Eye-Tracking (now called “Enkephalovision”) (Dimpfel, 2014).

According to discriminant analysis the projection of the effect of Rhodiola shows a rather similar colour in addition to its spacial relationship to the middle dosage of Zembrins. Rhodiola rosea extract is marketed in Germany and has been successfully clinically tested for its activating and stimulant effects (Dimpfel, 2014).
