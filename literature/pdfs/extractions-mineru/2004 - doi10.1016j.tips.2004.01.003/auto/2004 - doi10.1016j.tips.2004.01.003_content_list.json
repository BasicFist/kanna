This is due to an incomplete understanding of the functional importance of PDE4 subtypes and high-affinity and low-affinity inhibitorbinding conformers. However, recent developments have rekindled interest in the therapeutic potential of PDE4 inhibitors. First, PDE4 has been shown to be involved in cAMP signaling pathways that are affected by antidepressants. Second, data obtained using mouse knockout lines indicate that PDE4D and PDE4B mediate antidepressant effects. Third, it appears that the interaction of inhibitors with the high-affinity binding conformer of PDE4 is particularly important for antidepressant efficacy. These developments highlight the difficulties of dissociating the actions of PDE4 inhibitors and provide a guide for future research. ",

Subsequently, it was demonstrated that its pattern of effects is indicative of antidepressant efficacy [2], which was borne out later in a clinical trial [3]. Examination of the neuropharmacological actions of rolipram showed that it is a potent, highly selective inhibitor of type 4 PDE (PDE4), one of the 11-member superfamily of cyclic nucleotide PDEs [4]. These findings led to the suggestion that inhibitors of PDE4 might represent a novel class of antidepressant drugs, the potential of which is also being investigated for the treatment of inflammatory and immunological disorders [5,6]. Several factors have prevented the realization of the initial promise of therapeutic utility in depression. These include the lack of highly selective inhibitors of the four PDE4 subtypes, little knowledge of the involvement of each subtype in the signaling pathways that are involved in mediating antidepressant effects, and an incomplete understanding of the nature and consequences of two distinct PDE4 conformers with which inhibitors interact, termed the high-affinity and low-affinity rolipram-binding sites (HARBS and LARBS, respectively) [7].

Thus, it was of interest to determine whether PDE4 is involved in signaling mechanisms that are associated with these two neurotransmitters (Figure 2). PDE4 was found to be either the predominant or exclusive PDE that mediates the hydrolysis of cAMP formed by stimulation of $\\beta$ -adrenoceptors in rat cerebral cortex [26]. Furthermore, it appears that PDE4 is regulated via changes in noradrenalinemediated activity. Using 6-hydroxydopamine to induce noradrenergic lesions reduces both PDE4 activity and the expression of PDE4A and PDE4B subtypes. By contrast, enhancing noradrenaline-mediated activity by repeated administration of the reuptake inhibitor desipramine markedly increases the expression of these two PDE4 subtypes [27]. In addition, PDE4D regulates phosphorylation of the $\\beta$ -adrenoceptor by interacting with $\\beta$ arrestin [28,29]. Overall, these dataindicatethat PDE4 isa regulated component of cAMP signaling mediated by $\\beta$ -adrenoceptors.

However, some 5-HT-receptor subtypes are coupled positively to adenylyl cyclase, and so it is possible that PDE4 inhibitors enhance aspects of 5-HT-mediated neurotransmission that involve cAMP. Consistent with this suggestion, repeated treatment with an inhibitor of 5-HT reuptake such as fluoxetine increases the expression of PDE4A and PDE4B in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus [30–32]. It is unclear whether the antidepressant-induced increase in the expression of PDE4A and PDE4B, but not PDE4D, indicates that the two former subtypes are more involved in the signaling pathways that mediate the effects of antidepressants or whether the expression of PDE4D in the brain is less susceptible to regulation. PDE4D activity is particularly affected by phosphorylation, which indicates that this, rather than altered expression, might be its primary mode of regulation in the brain [33,34].

NMDA antagonists such as MK801 (dizocilpine) are reported to produce antidepressant-like effects on behavior [37,38]; however, this interpretation has been questioned [39]. Also, rolipram has been shown to reverse memory deficits that result from dizocilpine treatment, which indicates that the role of PDE4 in NMDA-receptor-mediated signaling might be related more to cognitive deficits that occur in depression [40]. Regardless of the exact nature of the functional role of PDE4 in NMDA receptor-mediated signaling, it does seem to be an important factor. Stimulation of NMDA receptors in primary cultures of rat cerebral cortical neurons increases intracellular concentrations of cAMP and cGMP. These neurons express enzymes from different PDE families, but the cAMP formed by NMDA-receptor stimulation is hydrolyzed exclusively by PDE4; the cGMP that forms is hydrolyzed by PDE2 only [41].

First, it contrasts with data obtained in rats, which shows that repeated treatment with antidepressants from different pharmacological classes increases the expression of PDE4A and PDE4B but not PDE4D [30,31]. Second, it is important to know to what degree the side-effects of emesis and sedation are related to inhibition of PDE4D. The first issue indicates either a species difference (i.e. that rats and mice utilize different PDE4 subtypes in particular signaling pathways) or that PDE4D might be regulated differently to PDE4A and PDE4B (e.g. by phosphorylation rather than altered expression). The second issue is somewhat more troubling. PDE4D appears to be expressed highly in the area postrema, an emetic-trigger zone [44], but its relative contribution to overall hydrolysis of cAMP in this region is not known. However, data obtained using a surrogate model that appears to be related to emetic potential, also indicate a role for PDE4D [45].

        "text": "Another level of complexity in understanding the actions of PDE4 inhibitors concerns the high-affinity and lowaffinity binding conformers (the HARBS and LARBS). The first indication that rolipram binding might be somewhat complex was the finding that whereas $[ ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { \\bar { H } } ]$ -rolipram binds with high affinity to brain membranes $( K _ { \\mathrm { i } } = 1 { - } 1 0 \\mathrm { n M } )$ , little high-affinity binding is detected in preparations of peripheral organs [46]. A systematic analysis of binding using a technique that assesses both high-affinity and lowaffinity interactions to recombinant PDE4A, showed that $[ ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { H } ]$ -rolipram binds with two distinct affinity states that differ $\\sim 5 0 0$ -fold in their apparent $K _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ values [7]. Both highaffinity and low-affinity interactions require the catalytic site; the N-terminal region of PDE4 stabilizes the highaffinity component of rolipram binding. Because both components of rolipram binding are to the catalytic site, they are described more accurately as distinct affinity states or conformers, rather than independent sites [47]. It should be noted that the HARBS and LARBS refer specifically to rolipram; some drugs exhibit high, equal affinity for both affinity states (e.g. piclamilast). ",

It appears to have important functional consequences because binding to each affinity state mediates a unique range of pharmacological effects. The order of potency of PDE4 inhibitors for producing some effects, such as induction of head twitches and tremor in mice, and emesis in ferrets, correlates with affinity for the HARBS; other effects, including inhibition of mast cell degranulation and antigen-induced T-cell proliferation in guinea-pigs appear to be more closely related to the LARBS [16,48–51].

PDE4 is expressed throughout the body, and so it is likely that this observation results from differences in the intracellular environment rather than an intrinsic difference between PDE4 in brain and peripheral tissues. Several factors affect the affinity of inhibitors for PDE4. These include the phosphorylation state of PDE4 and its interaction with proteins such as A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), receptors for activated C kinases 1 (RACK1) and proteins that contain SH3 domains [53–56]. Data obtained to date support the suggestion that the CNS effects of PDE4 inhibitors are mediated by the HARBS. Saccomano and coworkers [16] found that the relative potency of a series of inhibitors in reducing immobility of mice in the forcedswim test (an index of antidepressant efficacy) correlates with that of inhibition of $[ ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { H } ]$ -rolipram binding (an index of interaction with the HARBS). Similar data have been obtained recently using the forced-swim test in rats (Y. Zhao et al., unpublished). ",

If this increase in binding is a simple reflection of the overall increase in PDE4 expression that is observed [30,31], then an increase in binding to both conformers would be expected. The selective increase in inhibitor binding to the HARBS, together with the finding that this increase occurs in membrane but not cytosolic fractions, indicates that the antidepressants alter components of signaling pathways that involve PDE4. It appears that these antidepressant effects are secondary to enhanced noradrenaline-mediated and 5-HT-mediated neurotransmission, because prior lesion of these systems blocks the ability of desipramine and fluoxetine to increase binding of inhibitors to the HARBS [57].

This has proved difficult because the catalytic site to which PDE4 inhibitors bind is highly conserved across subtypes [10].

Given that the HARBS is present in brain but not peripheral tissues in appreciable numbers [52], it is likely that the intracellular milieu of CNS neurons (and, possibly, glia), results in a unique inhibitor-binding profile. Although many factors affect the binding of inhibitors to PDE4, including the phosphorylation state and several protein-protein interactions, as yet, none have been linked causally to the HARBS in vivo. Because factors that influence binding affinity of inhibitors often affect catalytic activity, they could provide a means to alter cAMP hydrolysis in specific signaling pathways independent of overt pharmacological inhibition. This might indicate novel ways to alter PDE4-related CNS function, including mediation of antidepressant activity. ",
