In western cultures, the purported therapeutic properties of Sceletium tortuosum have received limited scientific scrutiny; however, early research is promising.

More recently, a standardized extract of Sceletium tortuosum (trademarked as Zembrin®2) has accumulated a small body of evidence to support its safety, cognitive enhancing, anxiolytic properties, and identified potential biological mechanisms of action. With regards to safety, Nell, Siebert, Chellan, and Gericke (2013) demonstrated that both a low (8 mg) and a higher (25 mg) daily dose of Zembrin® ingested for 3 months were well tolerated in healthy participants. With regards to cognitive functioning, Dimpfel, Schombert, and Gericke (2016) demonstrated a dose‐dependent attenuation of spectral power following three acute doses of Zembrin® (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) to adult Fischer rats, and Chiu et al. (2014) demonstrated, in older human adults, improved cognitive set flexibility and executive function following 3 weeks of daily consumption (25 mg Zembrin® per day). With regard to the anxiolytic effect of Zembrin®, two studies have identified potential biological mechanisms of action, the first demonstrated Zembrin® to be a dual serotonin (5‐HT) transporter blocker and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase‐4 (Harvey, Young, Viljoen, & Gericke, 2011) and the second demonstrated a single 25 mg dose of Zembrin® could reduce anxiety‐related amygdala reactivity and attenuated amygdala–hypothalamus coupling in healthy young volunteers 2 h postdose (Terburg et al., 2013). To the authors' knowledge, the anxiolytic effects of Zembrin® are yet to be investigated in a behavioral study; therefore, we report for the first time the results of two behavioral studies that directly tested the anxiolytic properties of Zembrin®. The first study also investigated two additional purported properties―the effects on feelings of hunger and memory performance. We predict that Zembrin® will ameliorate stress/anxiety responding to acute laboratory stressors in healthy volunteers. ",

        "text": "The lack of an anxiolytic effect in study 1 and on subjective measures at the mid and poststress testing points in study 2 could most parsimoniously be explained by our protocol. For example, despite both protocols inducting elevated feelings of stress, it could be that the stressor was too “mild” to allow a treatment effect to be observed in those subjective self‐report measures. For example, it is clear that our participants did not rate their reported anxiety greater than the half‐way point on the anxiety scale nor score more than half on the STAI(s). However, it should be noted that an effect was observed in the physiological measure. With regard to a lack of effect on cognitive function, we could interpret this result as the first evidence to suggest that Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin®) has no impact on nonexecutive memory processing in healthy volunteers; however, we would advise some caution with this, as our primary aim was to investigate the anxiolytic properties and our research design was tailored toward this question and it is possible that again our lack of effect here can also be due to differences between our study and previous studies. For example, Terburg et al. (2013) utilized a longer treatment regime, tested a different population (older adults), and assessed different cognitive functioning (i.e., executive functioning). We recommend that future studies consider using protocols that elicit stronger stress responses, for example, adding critical social evaluation to the MTF (e.g., Wetherell et al., 2017), or running a longer, and more challenging social evaluation paradigm to further our understanding of the anxiolytic effects of Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin®). Future studies should also use more comprehensive cognitive assessment to investigate whether Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin®) has any task/cognitive domain specificity of effect. ",
