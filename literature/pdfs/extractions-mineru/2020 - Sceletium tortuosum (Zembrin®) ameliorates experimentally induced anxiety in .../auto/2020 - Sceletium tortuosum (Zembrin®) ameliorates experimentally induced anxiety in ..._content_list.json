Morerecently,a standardized extract of Sceletium tortuosum (trademarked as Zembrin@2) has accumulated a small body of evidence to support its safety，cognitive enhancing，anxiolytic properties,and identified potential biological mechanisms of action.With regards to safety, Nell, Siebert, Chellan,and Gericke (2013) demonstrated that both a low $( 8 \\mathsf { m g } )$ and a higher $( 2 5 \\mathsf { m g } )$ daily dose of Zembrin@ ingested for 3 months were well tolerated in healthy participants.With regards to cognitive functioning，Dimpfel, Schombert，and Gericke (2016) demonstrated a dose-dependent attenuation of spectral power following three acute doses of Zembrin? (2.5,5.0,and $1 0 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m g / k g ) }$ to adult Fischer rats,and Chiu etal.(2O14) demonstrated,in older human adults，improved cognitive set flexibility and executive function following 3 weeks of daily consumption $( 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } ~ \\mathrm { Z e m b r i n } ^ { \\textregistered }$ per day). With regard to the anxiolytic effect of Zembrin@,two studies have identified potential biological mechanisms of action,the first demonstrated Zembrin? to bea dual serotonin(5-HT) transporter blocker and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4 (Harvey,Young,Viljoen,& Gericke,2011) and the second demonstrated a single $2 5 ~ \\mathsf { m g }$ dose of Zembrin@ could reduce anxiety-related amygdala reactivity and attenuated amygdala-hypothalamus coupling in healthy young volunteers 2h postdose (Terburg et al.,2013).To the authors'knowledge, the anxiolytic effects of Zembrin@ are yet to be investigated in a behavioral study; therefore,we report for the first time the results of two behavioral studies that directly tested the anxiolytic properties of Zembrin@.The first study also investigated two additional purported properties-the effects on feelings of hunger and memory performance.We predict that Zembrin@ will ameliorate stress/anxiety responding to acute laboratory stressors in healthy volunteers.

(2013)utilized a longer treatment regime,tested a different population (older adults),and assessed different cognitive functioning (i.e.,executive functioning).We recommend that future studies consider using protocols that elicit stronger stress responses,for example,adding critical social evaluation to the MTF (e.g.,Wetherell et al., 2017),or running a longer,and more challenging social evaluation paradigm to further our understanding of the anxiolytic effects of Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin@).Future studies should also use more comprehensive cognitive assessment to investigate whether Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin@） has any task/cognitive domain specificity of effect.
