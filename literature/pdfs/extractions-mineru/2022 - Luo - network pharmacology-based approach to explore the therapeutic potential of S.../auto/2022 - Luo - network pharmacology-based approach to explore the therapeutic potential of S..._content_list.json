        "text": "Sceletium tortuosum (SCT) has been utilized medicinally by indigenous Koi-San people purportedly for mood elevation. SCT extracts are reported to be neuroprotective and have efficacy in improving cognition. However, it is still unclear which of the pharmacological mechanisms of SCT contribute to the therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this study investigated two aspects–firstly, the abilities of neuroprotective sub-fractions from SCT on scavenging radicals, inhibiting some usual targets relevant to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Parkinson’s disease (PD), and secondly utilizing the network pharmacology related methods to search probable mechanisms using Surflex-Dock program to show the key targets and corresponding SCT constituents. The results indicated sub-fractions from SCT could scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR). Furthermore, the results of gene ontology and docking analyses indicated the key targets involved in the probable treatment of AD or PD might be AChE, MAO-B, NMDAR subunit2B (GluN2B-NMDAR), adenosine A2A receptor and cannabinoid receptor 2, and the corresponding constituents in Sceletium tortuosum might be N-trans-feruloyl-3- methyldopamine, dihydrojoubertiamine and other mesembrine type alkaloids. In summary, this study has provided new evidence for the therapeutic potential of SCT in the treatment of AD or PD, as well as the key targets and notable constituents in SCT. Therefore, we propose SCT could be a natural chemical resource for lead compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. ",

NMDAR, an ionotropic glutamate receptor, which constitute a calcium-permeable component of fast excitatory neurotransmission, have been verified to participate neuro-physiologically in many cell signaling pathways resulting in several neurological diseases. An NMDAR inhibitor–esketamine was approved for depressive disorder ought to his rapid antidepressant action. The previous studies showed the potential of SCT on treating depressive disorder [2, 4, 28–33]. However, the results of this study indicated that the influence on NMDAR of these two fractions may be a subsequent effect resulted from affecting other targets but not NMDAR. Thus leading to a possibility that the anti-depressive action of SCT ",

Therefore, the neuroprotective SCT sub-factions were further tested in vitro for their efficacy on the potential targets. Encouragingly, the results of the fraction-targets in vitro experiments actually supported the network pharmacology results in this study. However, different sub-factions contained different natural products, the content of natural products were also various, which resulted in the different effects of different sub-factions to these potential target in this study.
