        "text": "Sceletium tortuosum (SCT) has been utilized medicinally by indigenous Koi-San people purportedly for mood elevation. SCT extracts are reported to be neuroprotective and have efficacy in improving cognition. However, it is still unclear which of the pharmacological mechanisms of SCT contribute to the therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this study investigated two aspects–firstly, the abilities of neuroprotective sub-fractions from SCT on scavenging radicals, inhibiting some usual targets relevant to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Parkinson’s disease (PD), and secondly utilizing the network pharmacology related methods to search probable mechanisms using Surflex-Dock program to show the key targets and corresponding SCT constituents. The results indicated sub-fractions from SCT could scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR). Furthermore, the results of gene ontology and docking analyses indicated the key targets involved in the probable treatment of AD or PD might be AChE, MAO-B, NMDAR subunit2B (GluN2B-NMDAR), adenosine $\\mathsf { A } _ { 2 \\mathsf { A } }$ receptor and cannabinoid receptor 2, and the corresponding constituents in Sceletium tortuosum might be N-trans-feruloyl-3- methyldopamine, dihydrojoubertiamine and other mesembrine type alkaloids. In summary, this study has provided new evidence for the therapeutic potential of SCT in the treatment of AD or PD, as well as the key targets and notable constituents in SCT. Therefore, we propose SCT could be a natural chemical resource for lead compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. ",

Furthermore, natural products generally consist of various and diverse active constituents depending on the extraction process [21], which can lead to neuroprotective fractions that exert neuroprotective effect of SCT and probably caused due to multiple constituents. Thus, it makes such investigations laborious and difficult to decipher the elicited mechanisms.

Hence, AChE may accelerate the progression of AD though promoting the fibration of $\\beta$ -amyloid [52]. Scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, produces a blocking of the activity of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and the concomitant appearance of transient cognitive amnesia and electrophysiological changes, which resemble those observed in AD [53, 54]. There are certain AChE inhibitors approved for AD, for example, donepezil and galanthamine. In fact, some studies had described the neuroprotective effect of AChE inhibitor [22, 23]. Hence, inhibiting AChE appears to be an underlying mechanism of the neuroprotective action of SCT. ",

According to the identified constituents from SCT in our previous study, the results of network pharmacology studies indicated some potential targets (AChE, MAOs and NMDAR) for SCT. Therefore, the neuroprotective SCT sub-factions were further tested in vitro for their efficacy on the potential targets. Encouragingly, the results of the fraction-targets in vitro experiments actually supported the network pharmacology results in this study. However, different sub-factions contained different natural products, the content of natural products were also various, which resulted in the different effects of different sub-factions to these potential target in this study. Certainly, in the next stage, the further studies would carry out to explain the bioactivity mechanism of different sub-fractions on their specific targets. ",
