Unrelated research has elucidated a significant link between cytokines and the mediation of depression. Therefore, the effect of Sceletium supplementation on immune cell functionality is of interest, since the efficacy of potential depression treatments could, at least in part, rely on downregulation of pro-inflammatory signalling.

Mitochondrial viability, as an indirect measure of cytotoxicity, and cytokine release in response to the treatment intervention were assessed. Results: Sceletium extract treatment was associated with increased mitochondrial viability, as well as up-regulated IL-10 release under basal conditions. LPS exposure significantly decreased mitochondrial viability, but this was prevented completely under Sceletium-treated conditions. The acute inflammatory response to LPS stimulation was not negatively affected. Sceletium treatment conferred most significant effects at a dose of 0.01 mg/ml. Conclusions: Sceletium exerts significant cytoprotective effects in the setting of endotoxin stimulation. Cytokine assessment indicated that Sceletium possesses mild anti-inflammatory properties, but does not hinder the mounting of an adequate immune response to acute immune challenge. These findings indicate that Sceletium may be beneficial for the attenuation of cytokine-induced depression, as well as in systemic low-grade inflammation. ",

Firstly, LPS is known to activate immune cells such as monocytes primarily by binding to Toll-like receptor 4, resulting in activation of intracellular kinases and transcription factors, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and NF-κB, respectively (Lu et al., 2010). The resultant immune response is characterised by release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and eicosanoids, all of which upregulates the immune response required for removal of the pathogen.

Secondly, the fact that the immune cells are protected from the nitric oxide (a free radical) that they secrete in response to LPS, also have implications in the context of sterile inflammation. It is known that many chronic diseases are characterised by increased levels of oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation. Thus, the potential for Sceletium to also have antioxidant capacity in this context, in combination with its illustrated anti-stress and antianxiety effects (Smith, 2011; Terburg et al., 2013), suggests that this plant medicine may be the magic bullet with which to counter the effects of many modern lifestyle-associated diseases. In further support of this notion, the striking cytoprotective effect of Sceletium was associated with significant desired modulatory effects in the context of inflammatory signalling. ",

Importantly, despite this effect, the monocytes could mount an adequate response to LPS stimulation in the presence of Trimesemine™, with a significant up-regulation of IL-10 secretion in response to increased IL-6 production induced by LPS. This result is positive, as it provides evidence to suggest that although a mild modulation by Trimesemine™ under basal conditions may have significance in terms of longer term clinical outcome, its consumption will not hinder the immune response to an acute, pathogenic challenge.

        "text": "Interestingly, when considering absolute cytokine levels, high-dose Trimesemine™ appeared to result in a smaller IL-6 response to LPS, which indirectly resulted also in decreased monocyte IL-10 secretion. However, when corrected for mitochondrial viability, this dose-effect was not maintained. This suggests that even small (statistically insignificant) differences in mitochondrial viability may affect the cell's functional capacity to produce and/or secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly. The more limited inflammatory cytokine response to LPS in the presence of higher dose Trimesemine™ may be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, the higher dose may limit the undesired symptomatic effects of the inflammatory hyper-response to LPS, which is a favourable clinical outcome. Secondly however, it is possible that this reduced response may be the result of detrimental immunosuppression. However, this seems unlikely, since the cytokine response was still significantly increased in response to LPS when compared to control. Rather, since the high dose employed in the current study represents a supraphysiological dose at least 100-fold higher than suggested daily consumption, this data suggest low risk of overdose, at least in terms of immune capacity and resistance to pathogenic infection.

This could account for the undetectable levels of IL-4 across all treatment groups in the current study, where cytokine assessments were carried out only after a 24-h intervention. This finding necessitates a need for more time points during the treatment period, to more comprehensively elucidate the secretion peaks for each relevant cytokine. This also indicates that IL-10 serves as a more viable marker for anti-inflammatory profile, as it provides more conclusive results when assessment of fewer time points apply. ",

It is hypothesised that immune activation may be related to depressionrelated neurotransmission defects, as pro-inflammatory cytokines themselves have been implicated in alterations in norepinephrine and serotonin/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) turnover in brain regions known to be involved in depression, including the amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Anderson and Maes, 2015; Dantzer, 2004; Godbout et al., 2005; Poon et al., 2015).
