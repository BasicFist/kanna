A mother plant obtained from Verve Dynamics (Pty) Ltd (a manufacturer and supplier of purified botanical extracts) was cultivated into three hundred plants used for this research study. Twenty treatments were evaluated with 15 sample replicates. Treatments were made up of 4 different soilless growing media, namely: pure silica sand, $5 0 \\%$ silica sand with $5 0 \\%$ coco-peat, $5 0 \\%$ silica sand with $5 0 \\%$ vermiculite, and $5 0 \\%$ silica sand with $5 0 \\%$ perlite. These growing media were tested in conjunction with 5 different fertigation regimes (FR). Plants grown in FR1 received aqueous nutrient solution once every week, FR2 received aqueous nutrient solution once every second week, FR3 received aqueous nutrient solution once every third week, FR4 received aqueous nutrient solution once every fourth week and FR5 received aqueous nutrient solution once every fifth week respectively. Results from this experiment showed that different soilless growing media and fertigation had varying effects on alkaloid concentrations in S. tortuosum. It was also observed that roots contained higher amounts of delta 7 mesembrenone and mesembrenone, while shoots contained higher amounts of the alkaloid mesembrine. ",

The biologically active ingredients locked up in plant tissues as secondary metabolites are the major drivers of plant-based treatments and are the target molecules by pharmaceutical, flavour, aroma, and agrochemical industries [1, 2]. Early detection of penicillin from mould, salicylic acid in willow bark, cardiotonic in foxglove and morphine from poppies aided the establishment of pharmaceutical industries [3]. In addition, increased knowledge about bioactive compounds in medicinal plants coupled with sustained efforts on the analysis of micronutrients that are responsible for this bioactivity has led to the development of refined and purified dose-dependent chemical compounds as drugs [3, 4, 5]. The present and future priority thus lie in finding new plant-based chemicals, bearing in mind, sustainable conservation, rational utilization, and biodiversity management [6]. ",

In S. tortuosum, alkaloids responsible for these psychoactive, sedative, euphoric properties and other biological activities are mesembrine and mesembrenone although, the concentration of alkaloids may vary within individual plants depending on their chemotype and degree of exposure to environmental stress [18, 19]. S. tortuosum is a succulent plant that belongs to the family Mesembryanthemaceae. It is indigenous to South Africa, especially in Namaqualand, where the plant is utilized regularly for its medicinal and psychoactive properties [20, 21]. With clear ethno-pharmaceutical value, it is also worthy to mention that the use of S. tortuosum develops no physical or psychological dependency [22]. ",

Alkaloid composition in different S. tortuosum plant extracts vary, and higher concentrations of certain alkaloids can have different medical properties. Thus, this study aimed to determine an optimal protocol for cultivating S. tortuosum with an adequate concentration of total alkaloids, as well as the alkaloids delta 7 mesembrenone, mesembrenone, and mesembrine to produce consistent high-quality medicinal plants.

Extractions were observed at $4 1 7 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ , the wavelength for the colour yellow, and analysed with the software program SkanIt™ which measured the number of yellow pigments in a sample, that is, the total amount of alkaloids [28].

These findings agree with [21], which states that mesembrine is the major alkaloid in S. tortuosum along with minor alkaloids delta 7 mesembrenone and mesembrenone. Further studies would be needed to test how other methods of fertigation, various organic/soilless media and a combination of both would affect the concentration yields of mesembrine-type alkaloids when cultivating S. tortuosum in soil or hydroponics.
