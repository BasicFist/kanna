Later, Japanese veterinary research showed that in the case of clinical diagnosis of dementia, Sceletium tortuosum reduced the cage pressure of companion animal cats and the night call of older cats 2. The first clinical case report on Sceletium tortuosum described its rapid onset of resistance to anxiety and depression 3. Then more and more plant supplements, healthy teas and beverages containing Sceletium tortuosum were available through farm stalls, health food stores, pharmacies and internet sales. These products are often used to promote calm and health, relieve stress, boost mood and reduce anxiety. In recent years, study found that it may delay chronic disease progression via alkaloiddependent antioxidant or anti-inflammatory action 4.

When the leaves are green, they are very juicy and can be dried, while the roots can be crushed with rocks, placed in plastic bags, and then mixed and dried. But wild Sceletium tortuosum is almost extinct due to excessive picking, and its commercial value prompts people to plant.

The high extract of Sceletium tortuosum was not only a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), but also a monoamine releasing agent 34. It played a role as a monoamine releasing agent (MRAs), like other MRAs, for example, cocaine and sertraline could exert analgesic effects by blocking the serotonin transporter (SERT) 35. Interestingly, the addiction effect of cocaine and its dual inhibition of SERT and dopamine transporter (DAT) were not applicable in Sceletium extracts 36. Sceletium extract and the pharmacological studies of the key alkaloids memesbrine, mesembrenone and mesembrenol reported that it only blocked the SERT but had no significant inhibitory effect on the DAT 17.

More and more animal studies have also confirmed that PDE4 inhibitors may be used to treat depression 50 while 5-HT reuptake inhibitors are also widely used in depression 51. Therefore, Sceletium tortuosum, a SSRI and PDE4 inhibitor, produce synergistic therapeutic potential in CNS disorders while providing greater symptomatic efficacy and broader therapeutic utility than the drug itself ? The answer is: yes. Since studies had shown that repeated treatment with SSRIs can upregulate PDE4 52, which in turn reduced sensitivity to long-term treatment of SSRIs, allowing both SSRIs and PDE4 to perform better and reduce side effects. This result suggests that dual treatment with SSRIs and PDE4 inhibitors may be a promising approach 53. Then this assumption was verified by Perrine et al. in their experiments. In two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging design experiments, Sceletium tortuosum was used as a dual inhibitor of SSRI and PDE4, showing reduced anxiety-related amygdala reactivity and amygdala-hypothalamic coupling compared with placebo which supported the further study of the clinical application of dual PDE4 and 5-HT reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of anxiety and depression 40.
