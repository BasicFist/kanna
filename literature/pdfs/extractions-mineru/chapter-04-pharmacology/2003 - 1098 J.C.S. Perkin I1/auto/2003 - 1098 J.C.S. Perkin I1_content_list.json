Extensive preparative chromatography of this fraction on both silica gel and alumina afforded ca. l00 mg of a non-crystalline base. The presence of a ·CH:CH·CO chromophore in this compound was indicated by the 1H n.m.r. spectrum which contained a pair of doublets at 8 6.12 and 7.09 (J 10 Hz) and by the presence of a carbonyl band at 1 680 cm-1 in the i.r. spectrum. An unresolved multiplet at 8 6.80 (3 H) and a singlet at 8 3.83 (6 H) in the 1H n.m.r. spectrum were in keeping with the presence of a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group characteristic of the mesembrine class of alkaloids. However, a 6 H singlet at 8 2.25 suggestive of a dimethylamino-function was not compatible with an alkaloid belonging to the mesembrine series. Furthermore, the mass spectrum contained a molecular ion at m|e 303 corresponding to C1gH22NOg and also, more importantly, exhibited a base peak at m|e 58 and an abundant ion at mle 72. The latter ions, which may be represented by structures (8) and (9), respectively, are characteristic of sceletium alkaloids of the joubertiamine class and originate from cleavage of the dimethylamino-side-chain.4 Spectral data indicated that this new base is 3'-methoxy-4'-O-methyljoubertiamine (6). In conformity with the suggested structure, the new base was identical with the product obtained by treating (—)-mesembrine methiodide with aqueous sodium carbonate. The constitution of this new alkaloid is of interest in that it is the first reported example in the joubertiamine series containing a dioxygenated aromatic ring.

Hudec 11 has concluded that β-aminoketones with an axial C-N bond should exhibit antioctant behaviour whereas those with an equatorial C-N bond have been predicted to exhibit octant behaviour. These latter systems possess the required parallel arrangement of the orbitals necessary for o-conjugation 15 may be achieved by the appropriate rotamer of a simple axial β-aminocyclohexanone having the conformation illustrated in structure (11). Contrary to Hudec's suggestion it would appear that σ conjugation in this class of compounds should not be excluded a priori from consideration. In (—)-mesembrine the bicyclic cis-fused ring system, with an axial aryl substituent, places certain constraints on the geometry around nitrogen and it necessary parallel orientation of the nitrogen lone-pair, the αβ o-bond, and the p orbitals of the carbonyl group, as required to permit interaction of the nitrogen lonepair and the carbonyl group through o conjugation. Supporting evidence for such interactions in these latter systems has been provided by a variety of experimental measurements including electronic absorption spectroscopy,12 photoelectron spectroscopy,13 and circular dichroism.14 In the c.d. studies it was found that removal of the lone-pair-carbonyl interaction by protonation of the equatorial nitrogen substituent resulted in a change of sign of the n>π\\* transition of the carbonyl group corresponding to antioctant behaviour.11 ",

However, when the negative Cotton effect of this alkaloid is considered in conjunction with the considerable wealth of information on the conformational and confi gurational properties of this series of alkaloids,2,6,16 normal octant behaviour is clearly established. To test the unlikely event that o-conjugation of the nitrogen lone-pair and the carbonyl group was responsible for the chiroptical properties of (—)-mesembrine, we examined the c.d. spectra of (—)-mesembrine hydrochloride and (—)-mesembrine methiodide; results are shown in Figure 3. Most surprisingly, the spectrum of the hydrochloride shows the absence of the n→π\\* band of a carbonyl group.

The remaining non-hydrogen atoms, save the N-methyl carbon atom, were located in two subsequent Fourier syntheses. Refinement of atomic positional and isotropic thermal parameters by full-matrix least-squares calculations reduced R from 0.21 to 0.14 at which point the position of the fi nal carbon atom was established from a difference-Fourier synthesis.
