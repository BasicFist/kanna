The southern African Khoisan fall into two genetic groups, loosely corresponding to the northwestern and southeastern Kalahari, which we show separated within the last 30,000 years. We find that all individuals derive at least a few percent of their genomes from admixture with non-Khoisan populations that began approximately 1,200 years ago.

A major open question concerns the relationships among these populations, who harbour extensive linguistic diversity (there are three Khoisan language families1–4) as well as variable modes of subsistence (while most Khoisan groups are hunter-gatherers, some are pastoralists). A second major question is the historical relationship of the southern African populations to two populations in eastern Africa that are or previously were hunter-gatherers and that also speak languages with click consonants (the Hadza and Sandawe). It has been hypothesized that the eastern Africans descend in part from a Khoisan-related hunter-gatherer population that once occupied a region ranging over much of southern and eastern Africa5. However, the anthropological and archaeological evidence for this hypothesis is contested6,7. Apart from shared use of click consonants, there is no linguistic evidence that the non-Bantu languages in southern Africa and Hadza stem from a common ancestor8–10, although a potential ancestral link between Sandawe and the Khoe-Kwadi family has been suggested4,11.

However, single locus studies have limited resolution. While some genome-wide studies have included southern Africans, they have largely focused on a single Khoisan group, making it impossible to elucidate relationships among these populations14–16.

This array is specifically designed for studies of population history: it contains panels of SNPs discovered by sequencing a single individual of known ancestry (including a Khoisan individual), providing precise control of the SNP ascertainment scheme and making it possible to answer questions that are more difficult to address using data from SNP arrays designed for medical genetics. We genotyped populations speaking languages from all three Khoisan language families (Tuu, Kxʼa, and Khoe-Kwadi1–4,8) (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Figure S1). We then merged the data with wholegenome sequencing data from five Sandawe individuals and five Hadza individuals20.

We capitalized on the design of the Human Origins array by performing the analysis using three different panels of SNPs, each of which reveals different aspects of population structure (Supplementary Figure S4). The Yoruba SNPs highlight structure within non-Khoisan Africans, while the French SNPs highlight European ancestry in the Nama (consistent with historic documentation23) and hint at European or east African ancestry in some Khoe groups  (Supplementary Figures S4, S6). The SNPs ascertained in a Ju|ʼhoan individual (HGDP “San”) reveal structure invisible to the other panels (Figure 1B). The PCA based on these SNPs divides Africans into three broad clusters: a predominantly non-Khoisan cluster and two Khoisan clusters. The Khoisan clusters do not correspond to linguistic affiliation; while one is comprised of Ju|ʼhoan_North and Ju|ʼhoan_South, who speak closely related languages/dialects, the other includes populations speaking languages belonging to all three language families (Supplementary Figure S1). The Khoisan clusters instead reflect geography, corresponding roughly to the northwestern and southeastern Kalahari (Figure 1A). On a fine scale, the PCA plot also identifies substructure within individual populations (Supplementary Methods), as well as cases of discordance between linguistic and genetic affiliation that suggest language shift with little accompanying gene flow. A particularly striking example is the Damara, who cluster with non-Khoisan populations despite speaking a Khoe language. This suggests that the Damara were a nonKhoisan population who acquired their language from their Khoisan neighbours (the Nama24) with little Khoisan gene flow25. ",

This is intriguing because if these populations were indeed unadmixed, they could be used as representatives of the ancestral northwestern and southeastern Kalahari populations. However, the three-population tests have limited power, and STRUCTURE-like methods may not be able to detect admixture if there is no unadmixed relative in the dataset (Supplementary Figure S9). We therefore developed a novel test for admixture that takes advantage of the fact that if and only if population mixture occurred, we expect to detect linkage disequilibrium (LD)—non-random association of SNP genotypes— that is correlated to the allele frequency differences between the two ancestral populations27,28 (Supplementary Figure S10). In all five populations, we observe LD that decays exponentially with genetic distance.

It has previously been shown that the time since admixture can be derived from the rate of LD decay27,29,30, and we also use this information below. The amplitude provides evidence of approximately 6% non-Khoisan ancestry in the Ju|'hoan_North (Figure 2A, Supplementary Methods). We then inferred the admixture proportions in the other southern Africans using a modified f4 ratio estimate19 that accounts for the admixture in the reference population (Figure 2B, Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Methods).

These dates are consistent with archeological evidence for the arrival of both east African pastoralists as well as agriculturalists (probably Bantu speakers) in southern Africa 2,000-1,200 years ago 32–35. PCA shows that the majority of admixture in the Khoisan is more closely related to the Yoruba (from west Africa, linguistically related to Bantu speakers) than to the Dinka (from northeastern Africa) (Supplementary Figure S5), though our data are consistent with additional east African ancestry in some Khoe-speakers (Supplementary Methods).

The excess of monomorphic SNPs beyond that expected due to genetic drift alone reflects new mutations that have arisen in the Ju|ʼhoan_North since the two populations split, and thus provides a measure of the time since the split (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Figure S15). We verified that this approach can provide accurate estimates of population split dates by simulation (Supplementary Figures S16, S17), and estimated that the split of the northwestern and southeastern Kalahari Khoisan occurred in the last 30,000 years (Supplementary Figures S18, S19).

TreeMix infers that the Hadza are admixed between a Khoisan population (equally related to both the northwestern and southeastern Kalahari groups) and a population most closely related to the Dinka, with about 23 ± 2% Khoisan-related ancestry (Supplementary Figure S20).

To explore the robustness of this finding, we used a fourpopulation test26 to determine whether the tree [Chimp, Ju|'hoan_North,[Hadza,Dinka]] is a good fit to the genome-wide allele frequencies. This tree fails with a Z-score of -4.8 (p = 8 x 10-7), indicating an excess of correlation in allele frequencies between the Ju|'hoan_North and Hadza. A consistent signal is seen in the Sandawe, although it is weaker (Z-score of -2.1; p = 0.018). Both the Hadza and the Sandawe show evidence of western Eurasian ancestry (perhaps reflecting gene flow from previously-admixed neighboring populations16); the weaker signal of relatedness between the Khoisan and the Sandawe may be due to a higher proportion of west Eurasian ancestry in the Sandawe (Supplementary Figure S22). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the Hadza and Sandawe harbor a proportion of their ancestry from a population related to southern Africans. Alternatively, more gene flow from an (as yet undiscovered) archaic human population into the ancestors of the Dinka than the Hadza (or Sandawe) could produce this signal. It has been suggested that the Mbuti and Biaka populations in central Africa may also be related to the Khoisan16,17; while our analyses show that these populations do carry deep human lineages, they do not share the signal of relatedness to the Khoisan that we are focusing on here (Supplementary Figure S23).

In black is the curve if we assume the Ju|ʼhoan_North are admixed; in grey if we assume the Yoruba are admixed (which serves as a negative control). The red line is the exponential curve fitted to the black points. B. Estimates of mixture proportions. We used the modified f4 ratio19 (Supplementary Methods) to estimate the fraction of non-Khoisan ancestry in each southern African population. C. Estimates of mixture dates. We used the rate at which admixture LD decays to estimate dates of admixture for all southern African populations (Supplementary Methods). We plot the means, with ranges representing one standard error. Not shown are the Wambo, who have no detectable curve, and hence may be unadmixed. The estimates of the mixture proportions and dates are also presented in Supplementary Table S4. ",

We extended TreeMix to build trees after subtracting out the effect of known admixture (Supplementary Methods) and then applied it to the Khoisan (excluding the Damara, who are genetically close to non-Khoisan). Populations are coloured according to their linguistic affiliation (Khoisan) or geographic location (dark grey = non-Khoisan African, light grey = Eurasian), and the chimpanzee was used as an outgroup. The bar chart next to each population shows the estimated ancestry proportions for each population: blue is the proportion of Khoisan ancestry, and red is the proportion of non-Khoisan ancestry. Note that the actual source of these two ancestries may vary among populations. The proportions are not identical to those presented in Figure 2B because of small differences in how they are estimated. The black dots show splits supported by more than 95% of bootstrap replicates, and the grey dots those supported by more than 80% of bootstrap replicates. ",

We then calculate the correlation between these two values, binning pairs of SNPs by the genetic distance between them. Each point is the value of this correlation (the y-axis) plotted against the genetic distance bin (the x-axis). A detectable curve suggests that the target population (in this case the Ju ’hoan) is admixed.

It should be noted that the “linguistic subgroup” given in the table does not represent the same level of linguistic relationship for all the populations. The group here called Ju|’hoan North largely corresponds to what is known as Ju ’hoan, often simply referred to as San in the literature. The Ju ’hoan South are also known as }Kx’au ’en. Since the dialectal boundaries are as yet uncertain and since both groups partly self-identified as Ju|’hoan, we here chose geographically defined labels. The HGDP “San” samples were included with the Ju|hoan North sample, since they clearly stem from this population [18] and empirically we cannot detect any genetic differentiation between them using the data from this study. For the Khwe, five samples each of the ||Xokhoe and ||Anikhoe subgroups were combined, while Damara and Nama individuals were chosen to represent the greatest diversity of traditional subgroups.

These vectors (and the best linear combination of them for approximating the genotypes of each individual) are then inferred by some algorithm. PCA and STRUCTURE-like approaches differ only in how the approximation is chosen [45]. In applications to population history, the inferred allele frequency vectors are often interpreted as “ancestral” frequencies from some set of populations (in the STRUCTURE-like framework), and the linear combination leading to an individual’s genotype as “admixture” levels from each of these populations. However, the inferred populations need never have existed in reality. Consider two historical scenarios: 1) an individual with 50% ancestry from a population with an allele frequency of 1 and 50% ancestry from a population with an allele frequency of 0; and 2) an individual with 100% ancestry from a population with an allele frequency of 0.5.

Though we have used different individuals for these two calculations, there could be unmodeled relationships between the individuals in the two sets. To test the robustness of the curves, we used ROLLOFF [27] . In ROLLOFF, the target population is used only to calculate LD, and two other populations are used as representatives of the putative mixing populations; see Moorjani et al. [27] for details. While demographic effects in the target population may influence LD, under the null model that the target population is unadmixed, the influence on LD will not be correlated to differences in allele frequencies between two unrelated populations. Results for using the Ju|’hoan North as the target population and various other pairs of populations as the mixing populations are shown in Supplementary Figure S12. There is a clear exponential decay of LD in nearly all cases. For example, the level of LD between two distant SNPs in the Ju ’hoan North is correlated with the divergence of those SNPs between the Yoruba and the French (Supplementary Figure S12); this is not expected if the Ju ’hoan North are unadmixed.

It is thus possible to identify demographic parameters which generate simulated data approximately similar to those observed. This is what is now called approximate Bayesian computation (see Pritchard et al. [43] and Beaumont et al.

This estimate is 27 1.7%, which is consistent with the TreeMix estimate. To ensure that this estimate is reasonable, we replaced the Hadza by the Bantu-speakers from Kenya from the HGDP (who are an eastern African population not expected to have any Khoisan ancestry) and performed the same analysis. We get an estimate of 3 ± 1.2% Khoisan ancestry, confirming the reliability of the estimate. ",

There is no signal of Neandertal or Denisova ancestry in the Dinka [21] , so the source of archaic gene flow would have to be an undiscovered population. We thus prefer the interpretation that the Hadza share ancestry with the Khoisan, though we acknowledge the possibility that future work will challenge this interpretation. ",

In particular, the relationship between the Sandawe and the European populations in these data is a poor fit. On inspection, the Hadza also show a similar signal, but to a lesser extent (Supplementary Figure S20D). We thus examined the Sandawe and Hadza for evidence of west Eurasian ancestry. We used f4 statistics of the form [Chimp, X,[French, Han]], where X is either the Sandawe or the Hadza. In both cases, this tree fails. For the Hadza, this tree fails with a Z-score of -4.2 (p = 1.3 × 10−5), and for the Sandawe, this tree fails with a Z-score of -7.2 (p = 3 × 10−13). Both of these are consistent with west Eurasian (either European or, more likely, Arabian), gene flow into these populations. To further examine this, we turned to ROLLOFF. We used Dinka and French as representatives of the mixing populations (since date estimates are robust to improperly specified reference populations). The results are shown in Supplementary Figure S22. Both populations show a detectable curve, though the signal is much stronger in the Sandawe than in the Hadza. The implied dates are 89 generations (≈2500 years) ago for the Hadza and 66 generations (≈2000 years) ago for the Sandawe. These are qualitatively similar signals to those seen by Pagani et al. [65] in Ethiopian populations.

To do this, we used the composite likelihood approach of Pickrell and Pritchard [36] , as implemented in the software TreeMix. Briefly, the approach is to build a graph of populations (which allows for both population splits and mixtures) that best fits the sample covariance matrix of allele frequencies [36] .

Imagine that there are several populations that we think a priori might be unadmixed (in our applications, these are the Chimpanzee, Yoruba, Dinka, Europeans, and East Asians). We first build the best tree of these unadmixed populations using the standard TreeMix algorithm.

We started by looking at f4 statistics of the form [Chimp, Ju|’hoan North, [X, Dinka]], where X is either the Mbuti or the Biaka. Recall that in the main text we show that, if X is the Hadza or Sandawe, this tree fails in a way that implies admixture between southern and eastern Africa. Here, these trees also fail (for Biaka, Z = 6.4, p = 7.7 × 10−11; for Mbuti, Z = 3.1, p = 0.001). However, these failures are in the opposite direction to those seen for the eastern Africans. Instead, these f4 statistic imply either archaic ancestry in the Mbuti and Biaka, or gene flow between the Khoisan and the Dinka. We examined whether this signal is robust to the choice of ascertainment panel, instead using the SNPs ascertained in a single Yoruba individual. In this panel, we see the same signals (for Biaka, Z = 9.6, p < 1 × 10−12 ; for Mbuti, Z = 6.8, p = 5 ×10−12). The signal of relatedness of the central Africans to the Khoisan is thus qualitatively and quantitatively different than that seen for the eastern Africans. ",
