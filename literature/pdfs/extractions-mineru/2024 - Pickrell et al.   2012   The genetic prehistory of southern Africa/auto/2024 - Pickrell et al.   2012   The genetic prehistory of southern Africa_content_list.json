The southern African Khoisan fall into two genetic groups, loosely corresponding to the northwestern and southeastern Kalahari, which we show separated within the last 30,000 years. We find that all individuals derive at least a few percent of their genomes from admixture with non-Khoisan populations that began approximately 1,200 years ago.

A major open question concerns the relationships among these populations, who harbour extensive linguistic diversity (there are three Khoisan language families1–4 ) as well as variable modes of subsistence (while most Khoisan groups are hunter-gatherers, some are pastoralists). A second major question is the historical relationship of the southern African populations to two populations in eastern Africa that are or previously were hunter-gatherers and that also speak languages with click consonants (the Hadza and Sandawe). It has been hypothesized that the eastern Africans descend in part from a Khoisan-related hunter-gatherer population that once occupied a region ranging over much of southern and eastern Africa5 . However, the anthropological and archaeological evidence for this hypothesis is contested6,7. Apart from shared use of click consonants, there is no linguistic evidence that the non-Bantu languages in southern Africa and Hadza stem from a common ancestor8–10, although a potential ancestral link between Sandawe and the Khoe-Kwadi family has been suggested4,11.

While some genome-wide studies have included southern Africans, they have largely focused on a single Khoisan group, making it impossible to elucidate relationships among these populations14–16.

We capitalized on the design of the Human Origins array by performing the analysis using three different panels of SNPs, each of which reveals different aspects of population structure (Supplementary Figure S4). The Yoruba SNPs highlight structure within non-Khoisan Africans, while the French SNPs highlight European ancestry in the Nama (consistent with historic documentation23) and hint at European or east African ancestry in some Khoe groups (Supplementary Figures S4, S6). The SNPs ascertained in a Ju|ʼhoan individual (HGDP “San”) reveal structure invisible to the other panels (Figure 1B). The PCA based on these SNPs divides Africans into three broad clusters: a predominantly non-Khoisan cluster and two Khoisan clusters. The Khoisan clusters do not correspond to linguistic affiliation; while one is comprised of Ju|ʼhoan_North and Ju|ʼhoan_South, who speak closely related languages/dialects, the other includes populations speaking languages belonging to all three language families (Supplementary Figure S1). The Khoisan clusters instead reflect geography, corresponding roughly to the northwestern and southeastern Kalahari (Figure 1A). On a fine scale, the PCA plot also identifies substructure within individual populations (Supplementary Methods), as well as cases of discordance between linguistic and genetic affiliation that suggest language shift with little accompanying gene flow. A particularly striking example is the Damara, who cluster with non-Khoisan populations despite speaking a Khoe language. This suggests that the Damara were a nonKhoisan population who acquired their language from their Khoisan neighbours (the Nama24) with little Khoisan gene flow25. ",

This is intriguing because if these populations were indeed unadmixed, they could be used as representatives of the ancestral northwestern and southeastern Kalahari populations. However, the three-population tests have limited power, and STRUCTURE-like methods may not be able to detect admixture if there is no unadmixed relative in the dataset (Supplementary Figure S9). We therefore developed a novel test for admixture that takes advantage of the fact that if and only if population mixture occurred, we expect to detect linkage disequilibrium (LD)—non-random association of SNP genotypes— that is correlated to the allele frequency differences between the two ancestral populations27,28 (Supplementary Figure S10). In all five populations, we observe LD that decays exponentially with genetic distance.

It has previously been shown that the time since admixture can be derived from the rate of LD decay27,29,30, and we also use this information below. The amplitude provides evidence of approximately $6 \\%$ non-Khoisan ancestry in the Ju|'hoan_North (Figure 2A, Supplementary Methods). We then inferred the admixture proportions in the other southern Africans using a modified $f _ { 4 }$ ratio estimate19 that accounts for the admixture in the reference population (Figure 2B, Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Methods).

The excess of monomorphic SNPs beyond that expected due to genetic drift alone reflects new mutations that have arisen in the Ju|ʼhoan_North since the two populations split, and thus provides a measure of the time since the split (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Figure S15). We verified that this approach can provide accurate estimates of population split dates by simulation (Supplementary Figures S16, S17), and estimated that the split of the northwestern and southeastern Kalahari Khoisan occurred in the last 30,000 years (Supplementary Figures S18, S19).

This tree fails with a Z-score of -4.8 $( \\mathsf { p } = \\mathsf { 8 } \\times \\mathsf { 1 0 } ^ { - 7 } )$ ), indicating an excess of correlation in allele frequencies between the Ju|'hoan_North and Hadza. A consistent signal is seen in the Sandawe, although it is weaker (Z-score of -2.1; ${ \\rho } = 0 . 0 1 8 ^ { \\cdot }$ ). Both the Hadza and the Sandawe show evidence of western Eurasian ancestry (perhaps reflecting gene flow from previously-admixed neighboring populations16); the weaker signal of relatedness between the Khoisan and the Sandawe may be due to a higher proportion of west Eurasian ancestry in the Sandawe (Supplementary Figure S22). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the Hadza and Sandawe harbor a proportion of their ancestry from a population related to southern Africans. Alternatively, more gene flow from an (as yet undiscovered) archaic human population into the ancestors of the Dinka than the Hadza (or Sandawe) could produce this signal. It has been suggested that the Mbuti and Biaka populations in central Africa may also be related to the Khoisan16,17; while our analyses show that these populations do carry deep human lineages, they do not share the signal of relatedness to the Khoisan that we are focusing on here (Supplementary Figure S23). In sum, these results strongly suggest a genetic link between populations in southern and eastern Africa that speak non-Bantu languages with heavy use of click consonants. ",

This analysis provides strong evidence for a shared origin for the Khoisan-related genetic material in the Hadza and Sandawe.

Finally, we demonstrate an ancient link between the Khoisan and the Hadza and Sandawe in eastern Africa. This has implications for the geographic origin of modern humans, for which both eastern and southern Africa have been proposed17,37,38. Present-day populations in southern and eastern Africa are located on both sides of the deepest split of the tree (Figure 3), and thus from the perspective of phylogeography, our results are equally consistent with both of these locations as the origin of modern humans.

We then binned pairs of SNPs by the genetic distance between them. For each bin, we plot the regression coefficient (over SNP pairs in the bin) from regressing the level of LD on the product of the allele frequency differences.

At each pair of SNPs, we estimate the amount of LD in the Ju|’hoan North (as measured by a correlation in genotypes [27] ) and the product of the differences in allele frequency between two reference populations. The reference populations in each panel are listed to either side of the Ju|’hoan North. We then calculate the correlation between these two values, binning pairs of SNPs by the genetic distance between them. Each point is the value of this correlation (the y-axis) plotted against the genetic distance bin (the x-axis). A detectable curve suggests that the target population (in this case the Ju|’hoan) is admixed.

It should be noted that the “linguistic subgroup” given in the table does not represent the same level of linguistic relationship for all the populations. The group here called Ju|’hoan North largely corresponds to what is known as Ju|’hoan, often simply referred to as San in the literature. The Ju|’hoan South are also known as $\\pm \\mathrm { K x } ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { a u } | |$ ’en. Since the dialectal boundaries are as yet uncertain and since both groups partly self-identified as Ju|’hoan, we here chose geographically defined labels. The HGDP “San” samples were included with the Ju|hoan North sample, since they clearly stem from this population [18] and empirically we cannot detect any genetic differentiation between them using the data from this study. For the Khwe, five samples each of the $| |$ Xokhoe and $| |$ Anikhoe subgroups were combined, while Damara and Nama individuals were chosen to represent the greatest diversity of traditional subgroups. Since not enough samples were available from all the different Taa dialects, the subgroups of Taa investigated here were chosen based on both linguistic and geographic criteria; they do not correspond to any single linguistic unit. The Taa West group includes speakers of the West !Xoon and !Ama dialects, Taa North comprises speakers of the East !Xoon dialect, and Taa East includes speakers of the Tshaasi and $^ { \\ddag }$ Huan dialects.

This genetic substructure correlates with a major linguistic boundary: the individuals falling into the southeast Kalahari cluster speak the West !Xoon dialect of Taa, while three of the other individuals speak the !Ama dialect. In the case of the Hai||om, four individuals cluster close to the Tshwa and Khwe, while the other five cluster with the !Xuun. This genetic substructure in the Hai||om reflects geographic variation: the five individuals that show affnities with the !Xuun come from close to the Angolan border in northern Namibia, where the two groups are settled in close proximity, while the remaining Hai||om come from the Etosha area further to the southwest. Conversely, for some groups the known ethnolinguistic subdivisions do not correspond to genetic distinctions. Thus, the Damara sample included four individuals from Sesfontein, and the Nama sample included five Topnaar from the Kuiseb Valley; these groups are linguistically distinct [44], but appear genetically indistinguishable from other Damara and Nama, respectively.

We performed a PCA projection where we first ran the analysis using only the Ju|’hoan North, Yoruba, and Dinka, and then projected the remaining Khoisan populations on the identified PCs. In this analysis, the Yoruba represent western African populations and the Dinka represent eastern African populations. This analysis was performed on the French-ascertained SNPs, as these are the SNPs where a potential eastern African signal in some of the southern Africans is seen in Supplementary Figure S4C. The results are shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The projected samples fall on a line between their Bantu-speaking neighbors and the Ju|’hoan North.

A positive $f _ { 4 }$ statistic indicates gene flow between X and a population related to the French (or alternatively gene flow between populations related to the Yoruba and Han). The most strongly positive $f _ { 4 }$ statistic in the southern African populations is for the Nama (Supplementary Figure S6A), as expected if they have experienced European admixture. To confirm the direction of this gene flow, we used ROLLOFF [27] to test if there is detectable admixture LD in the Nama. If we use the Ju|’hoan North and the French as the putative mixing populations, there is clear admixture LD (Supplementary Figure S6B), we date this mixture to approximately five generations ( ${ \\approx } 1 5 0$ years) ago. The single exponential curve does not perfectly fit the curve in the Nama at shorter genetic distances (Supplementary Figure S6B), indicating that they were likely admixed with some non-Khoisan group at the time of the European admixture.

These are useful approaches to summarizing the major components of variation in genetic data. More formally, these approaches attempt to model the genotypes of each sampled individual as a linear combination of unobserved allele frequency vectors. These vectors (and the best linear combination of them for approximating the genotypes of each individual) are then inferred by some algorithm. PCA and STRUCTURE-like approaches differ only in how the approximation is chosen [45]. In applications to population history, the inferred allele frequency vectors are often interpreted as “ancestral” frequencies from some set of populations (in the STRUCTURE-like framework), and the linear combination leading to an individual’s genotype as “admixture” levels from each of these populations. However, the inferred populations need never have existed in reality. Consider two historical scenarios: 1) an individual with $5 0 \\%$ ancestry from a population with an allele frequency of 1 and $5 0 \\%$ ancestry from a population with an allele frequency of $0$ ; and 2) an individual with $1 0 0 \\%$ ancestry from a population with an allele frequency of 0.5.

This concern arises because we use the Khoisan population twice in Equation S2 (population $C$ )–both to calculate allele frequencies and to calculate linkage disequilibrium. Though we have used different individuals for these two calculations, there could be unmodeled relationships between the individuals in the two sets. To test the robustness of the curves, we used ROLLOFF [27] . In ROLLOFF, the target population is used only to calculate LD, and two other populations are used as representatives of the putative mixing populations; see Moorjani et al. [27] for details. While demographic effects in the target population may influence LD, under the null model that the target population is unadmixed, the influence on LD will not be correlated to differences in allele frequencies between two unrelated populations. Results for using the Ju|’hoan North as the target population and various other pairs of populations as the mixing populations are shown in Supplementary Figure S12. There is a clear exponential decay of LD in nearly all cases. For example, the level of LD between two distant SNPs in the Ju|’hoan North is correlated with the divergence of those SNPs between the Yoruba and the French (Supplementary Figure S12); this is not expected if the Ju|’hoan North are unadmixed.

There are two main approaches that have been applied to this problem in the past. The first approach is based on the observation that it is often impossible to write down the probability of seeing genetic data under a given demographic model, but it is quite easy to simulate data under essentially any demographic model. It is thus possible to identify demographic parameters which generate simulated data approximately similar to those observed. This is what is now called approximate Bayesian computation (see Pritchard et al. [43] and Beaumont et al. [54] for a more formal description), and this approach has been applied to estimating split times between populations in a number of applications (e.g. [55–57]). ",

However, true population history is almost certainly more complex than can be modeled. For estimates of population split times, however, the population demography is a nuisance parameter, and we do not wish to estimate it. We will attempt to estimate split times with an approach that, in principle, is valid in situations of arbitrary demographic complexity (with some caveats to come later). The approach we will take is most similar in spirit to Gutenkunst et al. [58], but tailored specifically to our data. The main idea is roughly as follows: after the split of two populations, a given chromosome from one of the populations accumulates mutations at a clock-like rate. We wish to count those mutations, and convert this count to absolute time. ",

We have an outgroup population $O$ , and two populations whose split time $t$ we wish to estimate, $X$ and $Y$ . The population ancestral to $X$ and $Y$ is called $A$ . An important modeling assumption is that after populations split, there is no migration between then. Now imagine we have identified a number of sites that are heterozygous in a single individual from $Y$ (in applications later on, this will be the Ju|’hoan North; recall that this is the exact ascertainment scheme used on the Human Origins array). Looking backwards in time, these are simply all the sites where a mutation has occurred on either of the two chromosomes before they coalesce, and can be split into two groups–the mutations that arose on the lineage to $Y$ (these are the red stars in Supplementary Figure S15A) and those that did not (and thus were polymorphic in $A$ ; these are the black stars in Supplementary Figure S15A, and the allelic spectrum in $A$ is shown in Supplementary Figure S15B)). Now consider the allele frequencies in $X$ . The new mutations that arose on the lineage to $Y$ are of course not polymorphic in $X$ , which leads to a peak of alleles with frequency zero in both the ancestral population and in $X$ (Supplementary Figure S15B,C). More formally, let $f ( x )$ be the allelic spectrum in $A$ conditional on ascertainment in a single individual from $Y$ . This spectrum can be split into two parts: ",

We assume $g ( x )$ is a quadratic of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ .

Some caveats of interpretation here are warranted. First, all the Khoisan populations have some level of admixture with non-Khoisan populations. There is thus no single “split time” in their history, and any method (like the one used here) that estimates a single such time will actually be estimating a composite of several signals. Second, we have made the modeling assumption that history involves populations splitting in two with no gene flow after the split. More complex demographies are quite plausible, but render the interpretation of a split time nearly meaningless (if populations continue to exchange migrants after “splitting”, they arguably have not split at all). We thus consider strong interpretations of split times estimated from genetic data to be impossible, but we nonetheless find the estimates to be useful in constraining the set of historical hypotheses that are consistent with the data.

The split time of interest is that with the southeastern Kalahari groups (the red points in Supplementary Figure S18). The population with the least non-Khoisan ancestry is the Taa North; we show the empirical and fitted allele frequency spectra for this population in Supplementary Figure S19A, and the simulated allele frequency spectrum from a simulation with an older date of 2,000 generations in Supplementary Figure S19B.

The fraction of Khoisan ancestry in the Hadza is estimated at $2 3 \\pm 2 \\%$ (from a block jackknife in blocks of 500 SNPs). The residual fit from this graph is shown in Supplementary Figure S20D. The residual covariance of the Hadza with all populations except the Yoruba are less than three standard errors away from the fitted model; for the fit of the covariance between the Yoruba and the Hadza, the fit is 3.5 standard errors away. Indeed, the Yoruba are particularly poorly fitted in this graph, and the worst fit in this graph is for the fit between the Yoruba and the Chimpanzee (Supplementary Figure S20D).

We began by building the maximum likelihood tree of populations including the Sandawe using TreeMix (Supplementary Figure S21A). Like the Hadza, the Sandawe are poorly fitted by a tree (Supplementary Figure S21B), so we allowed a single migration edge. The inferred migration event is from a population related to the Khoisan, like we previously saw in the Hadza (Supplementary Figure S21C). The TreeMix estimate is that the Sandawe trace about 18% of their ancestry to a population related to the Khoisan. ",

In particular, the relationship between the Sandawe and the European populations in these data is a poor fit. On inspection, the Hadza also show a similar signal, but to a lesser extent (Supplementary Figure S20D). We thus examined the Sandawe and Hadza for evidence of west Eurasian ancestry. We used $f _ { 4 }$ statistics of the form [Chimp, X,[French, $\\mathrm { H a n l l }$ , where $\\mathrm { X }$ is either the Sandawe or the Hadza. In both cases, this tree fails. For the Hadza, this tree fails with a Z-score of -4.2 ( $p = 1 . 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ ), and for the Sandawe, this tree fails with a Z-score of -7.2 ( $p = 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 }$ ). Both of these are consistent with west Eurasian (either European or, more likely, Arabian), gene flow into these populations. To further examine this, we turned to ROLLOFF. We used Dinka and French as representatives of the mixing populations (since date estimates are robust to improperly specified reference populations). The results are shown in Supplementary Figure S22. Both populations show a detectable curve, though the signal is much stronger in the Sandawe than in the Hadza. The implied dates are 89 generations ( ${ \\approx } 2 5 0 0$ years) ago for the Hadza and 66 generations ( ${ \\approx } 2 0 0 0$ years) ago for the Sandawe. These are qualitatively similar signals to those seen by Pagani et al. [65] in Ethiopian populations. There are two possible historical scenarios that could lead to these signals: either the Hadza and Sandawe both directly admixed with a western Eurasian population about 2,000 years ago, or ",

To do this, we used the composite likelihood approach of Pickrell and Pritchard [36] , as implemented in the software TreeMix. Briefly, the approach is to build a graph of populations (which allows for both population splits and mixtures) that best fits the sample covariance matrix of allele frequencies [36] .

Imagine that there are several populations that we think a priori might be unadmixed (in our applications, these are the Chimpanzee, Yoruba, Dinka, Europeans, and East Asians). We first build the best tree of these unadmixed populations using the standard TreeMix algorithm.

We thus tested whether these populations share the same signal of relatedness to the Khoisan as we see in the eastern Africans. We started by looking at $f _ { 4 }$ statistics of the form [Chimp, Ju|’hoan North, [X, Dinka]], where X is either the Mbuti or the Biaka. Recall that in the main text we show that, if $\\mathrm { X }$ is the Hadza or Sandawe, this tree fails in a way that implies admixture between southern and eastern Africa. Here, these trees also fail (for Biaka, $Z = 6 . 4$ , $\\mathrm { p } = 7 . 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 }$ ; for Mbuti, $\\mathrm { Z = }$ 3.1, $\\mathrm { p = 0 . 0 0 1 }$ ). However, these failures are in the opposite direction to those seen for the eastern Africans. Instead, these $f _ { 4 }$ statistic imply either archaic ancestry in the Mbuti and Biaka, or gene flow between the Khoisan and the Dinka. We examined whether this signal is robust to the choice of ascertainment panel, instead using the SNPs ascertained in a single Yoruba individual. In this panel, we see the same signals (for Biaka, $Z = 9 . 6$ , $\\mathrm { ~ p ~ < ~ 1 ~ } \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 }$ ; for Mbuti, $Z = 6 . 8$ , $\\mathrm { ~ p ~ = ~ 5 ~ } \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 }$ ). The signal of relatedness of the central Africans to the Khoisan is thus qualitatively and quantitatively different than that seen for the eastern Africans. ",
