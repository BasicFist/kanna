It is standardized to contain 0.35–0.45% total alkaloids (mesembrenone and mesembrenol ≥60%, and mesembrine <20%). A 14-day repeated oral toxicity study was conducted at 0, 250, 750, 2500, and 5000 mg/kg bw/ day. A 90-day subchronic repeated oral toxicity study was conducted at 0, 100, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg bw/day. Because S. tortuosum has a long history of human use for relieving stress and calming, a functional observation battery, including spontaneous locomotor activity measured using LabMaster ActiMot light-beam frames system, was employed. Several parameters, such as locomotion, rearing behavior, spatial parameters, and turning behavior were investigated in the final week of the study. No mortality or treatment-related adverse effects were observed in male or female Crl:(WI)BR Wistar rats in the 14- or 90-day studies. In the 14- and 90-day studies, the NOAELs were concluded as 5000 and 600 mg/kg bw/ d, respectively, the highest dose groups tested. ",

Br. has an ancient oral history of use as a masticatory preparation and health tea by indigenous San and Khoi people. The first written record of the plant being used by indigenous people, accompanied by a painting of the plant, is from the year 1685 (Waterhouse et al., 1979). Tinctures (hydroethanolic extracts) of the plant were reported to be in common use by colonists of the Cape of Good Hope (Pappe, 1868) and can still be purchased from health shops, pharmacies, and farm stalls in South Africa. Packages of S. tortuosum tea bags, often in combination with Red Bush Tea (Aspalathus linearis) or Honeybush tea (Cyclopia spp.), are sold in supermarkets in South Africa. Over the last 15 years, increasing numbers of Sceletium-based products, including teas, tinctures, tablets, capsules, and raw powdered plant material, often sold over the Internet, are being used by healthy individuals to promote a sense of well-being and to relieve stress (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008).

A wide range of variation of the alkaloid chemistry in wild Sceletium plants has been described (Shikanga et al., 2012), indicating the necessity of selecting naturally occurring and traditionally used plant chemotypes for commercial production and standardizing extracts of these plants to both the total alkaloid content and the alkaloid composition in order to have high quality commercial products. The four major S. tortuosum alkaloids (mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol, and mesembranol) have been shown in vitro to be permeable across porcine intestinal, sublingual, and buccal mucosa (Shikanga et al., 2012).

In the cage positioned into the frame, the X-axis represented length (54 cm), the Y-axis represented depth (29 cm), and the Z-axis represented height (41 cm). Within the ActiMot system frame, movement along the X-axis was monitored by 16 sensors (emitter and receiver pairs) installed along the long sides (54 cm) and movement along the Y-axis was monitored by eight sensors installed along the short sides (29 cm), respectively, of one flat frame. Movement along the Z-axis was monitored by 16 sensors installed along the long sides (54 cm) of a second flat frame parallel to and above the X/Y flat frame (i.e., the Z-axis sensor array was parallel to the X-axis sensor array and no sensors were installed in the short sides of the “Z level” frame). The position of the flat frame containing the “Z level” sensor array was vertically adjustable along the Z-axis by sliding up and down the four vertical corner frame posts of the system. The X- and Y-axis sensor arrays jointly monitored horizontal activity/movement, the Z-axis sensor array monitored vertical activity/ movement, and computer software algorithms translated spatial temporal beam interruption patterns into animal activity patterns representing the evaluated parameters.

Renal paleness was observed in one male of the 2500 mg/kg dose group. A smaller than normal prostate was observed in one male (animal #2412) of the high-dose group, and slight or moderate hydrometra (indicative of the estrous cycle of the female animals) was observed in one to three females per group in the control group and all, except the 750 mg/kg, dose groups (Table 5). The small prostate, which is seen occasionally in untreated experimental rats, was considered to be an individual alteration unrelated to administration of the test-article. The renal changes (pyelectasia and paleness) and hydrometra are speciesspecific alterations that occur in untreated animals of this species and strain and were not considered to be test article-related. No other gross pathological lesions were observed in any animals of the treatment or control groups. ",

The repeated administration of Zembrin® for 90 days by gavage to Wistar rats resulted in a NOAEL of 600 mg/kg bw/day. Applying a 100-fold uncertainty factor to compensate for inter- and intraspecies differences, results can be extrapolated to an acceptable daily intake of 420 mg by a 70 kg human. Zembrin® is intended to be used as an ingredient in functional foods, beverages, and dietary supplements. The recommended consumption is 25 mg per day. This is 0.357 mg/kg bw/day in a 70 kg adult, which is 1680 times less than the NOAEL of 600 mg/kg bw/ day.
