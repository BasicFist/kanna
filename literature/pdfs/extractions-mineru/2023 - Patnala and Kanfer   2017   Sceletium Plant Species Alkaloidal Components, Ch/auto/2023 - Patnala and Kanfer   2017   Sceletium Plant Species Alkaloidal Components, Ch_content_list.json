There are currently eight reported species divided into two main “types” with five species in the tortuosum and three in the emarcidum type. It has been observed that, in general, mesembrine‐type alkaloids such as mesembrenol, $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone, mesembranol, mesembrenone, mesembrine and epime‐ sembranol as well as some non‐mesembrine type such as Sceletium A4, tortuosamine and joubertiamine occur in the tortuosum type; the emarcidum type is devoid of alkaloids. Morphological identification of species type presents a formidable challenge, where subtle differences are found in the secondary veins that branch off from the middle vein toward the leaf margin. In view of the fact that the plant contains a complex mixture of closely related compounds, in particular alkaloidal components, separation techniques and their application to evaluate specific chemical components are an important aspect which permits accurate characterization and quantification. In addition, the develop‐ ment of appropriate analytical methods for chemotaxonomic studies has provided valu‐ able information to confirm specific plant identity. Importantly, these methods are also required for the quality control of plant material used to manufacture complementary and traditional medicines containing Sceletium. ",

The molecular formula for “mesembrin” was reas‐ signed as ${ \\mathrm { C } } _ { 1 7 } { \\mathrm { H } } _ { 2 3 } { \\mathrm { N O } } _ { 3 }$ and is presently known as mesembrine, suggesting that the molecule belonged to the tropane ester alkaloid group.

Subsequently, ammo‐ nia solution was used to neutralize and result in alkaline solution, and the latter was further extracted with dichloromethane (DCM). The DCM fractions were collected into a round‐ bottomed flask and evaporated under vacuum to yield a brown viscous liquid containing alkaloids. Following the separation of components by column chromatography, collected elu‐ ents were spotted on a TLC plate (Figure 4).

In particular, with respect to the Sceletium plant species which contain closely related mesem‐ brine‐type compounds of which some are epimers and have isobaric chemistries [17], specific methods are necessary. Since HPLC using UV detection cannot discriminate between such compounds, detection by MS enhances the accuracy and specificity of the analytical method, thereby reducing the risk of using an inappropriate Sceletium species for the indications on the product label [22]. In addition, this method proved valuable to monitor the fermentation process of Sceletium plant material [24]. Hence, the current qualitative LCMS method, and concurrent application of the previously reported quantitative assay method [22], provides valuable analytical procedures for the identification and QC of Sceletium plant material and its dosage forms. The application of the LC‐ESI‐MS tandem mass spectroscopy provides unique fragmentation patterns which facilitates the identity of specific alkaloid in complex matrices and thus provides valuable confirmatory data for chemotaxonomic studies [11].

        "text": "The traditional preparation of Sceletium known as “Kougoed” or “Channa” is a fermented prep‐ aration used by the native Bushmen of Namaqualand. Traditionally, its main use for its psy‐ choactive properties involved a prior fermentation by the Khoisan tribe of southern Africa, who purported that the psychoactive effect of this plant is greatly enhanced [2, 3]. Based on this perception, Sceletium plants and their products are marketed with claimed improve‐ ments in mood and reduction of anxiety, when the fermented plant material is used either by chewing or smoking. In general, the fermentation process involves crushing the whole plant material or aerial parts which are then placed in sealed containers for several days and dried under natural sunlight. Patnala [17, 24] subsequently confirmed that the fermentation process transforms mesembrine to $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone and requires an aqueous environment together with the presence of light to facilitate such a transformation.

        "text": "The study of the phytochemical composition of Sceletium was provoked as a result of anec‐ dotal information describing the use of these plants by early inhabitants of Southern Africa [28]. Typical examples of medicinal use have been described in the Ethnopharmacology sec‐ tion above. It can be gleaned from current scientific literature that several scientific groups working on various aspects of Sceletium plants have focused on the biological activity of these alkaloids [29]. It should be noted that antidepressant activity of mesembrine‐type alkaloids has been demonstrated in animal models, of which, where mesembrine has been the principal alkaloid. The antidepressant activity is reportedly based on selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and mesembrine has a weak narcotic effect [30]. A recent study indicates that high‐ mesembrine Sceletium extract is a monoamine releasing agent, rather than only a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [31]. Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ a marketed product containing a standardized extract of Sceletium tortuosum has been studied using human volunteers for its acute effects in the brain, and its pharmacological activity and potential therapeutic effect are reported to be based on the inhibiting reuptake of 5‐HT and PDE4. It is suggested that a $2 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ dose of Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ has the potential of reducing anxiety in humans [32]. ",

Furthermore, the identified alkaloidal constituents vary between each of these plant species. In the tortuosum‐type plants, mesembrenone (Table 2, No. 8), where the double bond occurs between C4‐5; Δ7mesembrenone (Table 3, No. 15), where the double bond occurs between C7‐7a; and the epimers, mesembranol and epimesembranol, clearly have closely related chemical structures. Hence, accurate identification and characterization is nec‐ essary to confirm the true identity of each species [22] in view of the close similarity between such chemical structures. such relevant information provides invaluable data to confirm the true identity of each species. These “tortuosum”‐type Sceletium species contain mesembrine as the major alkaloid along with other minor alkaloids, $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone, mesembrenone and mesembranol and clearly differ from the other species. However, a subspecies of tortuo‐ sum type, S. strictum contains mesembrenone as the major alkaloidal component alongside mesembrine [11]. The above‐mentioned information can be gleaned from published studies on Sceletium plants [17, 22, 24]. ",

However, there is growing concern relating to quality, safety and efficacy of such products where regulatory requirements relating to the provision of such necessary evidence currently leaves a lot to be desired and in instances have demonstrated undesirable risks to vulnerable users. Proper quality control requires the application of appropriate analytical techniques to assess the identity and quality of complementary medicines containing plant material. Quality control methods require access and availability to reference standards for each product which is mar‐ keted for medicinal use. As far as Sceletium‐based products are concerned, the information relating to isolation, identification, quantification and purification of individual alkaloidal compounds found in Sceletium species provides valuable data for use in the quality con‐ trol of medicines containing Sceletium plant material. While quality control is an essential component to ensure the quality of medicines, evidence of the safety and efficacy is further essential components, and it is important that such data are generated through clinical trials in humans. Furthermore, the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) of administered products and associated kinetics should be studied. Such studies require the development and validation of appropriate analytical techniques to monitor the active ingredient(s) and the resulting metabolite(s) where applicable. ",
