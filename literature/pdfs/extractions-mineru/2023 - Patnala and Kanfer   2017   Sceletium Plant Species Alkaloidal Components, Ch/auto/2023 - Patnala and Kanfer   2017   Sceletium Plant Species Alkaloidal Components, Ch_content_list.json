There are currently eight reported species divided into two main “types” with five species in the tortuosum and three in the emarcidum type. It has been observed that, in general, mesembrine‐type alkaloids such as mesembrenol, Δ7mesembrenone, mesembranol, mesembrenone, mesembrine and epime‐ sembranol as well as some non‐mesembrine type such as Sceletium A4, tortuosamine and joubertiamine occur in the tortuosum type; the emarcidum type is devoid of alkaloids. Morphological identification of species type presents a formidable challenge, where subtle differences are found in the secondary veins that branch off from the middle vein toward the leaf margin. In view of the fact that the plant contains a complex mixture of closely related compounds, in particular alkaloidal components, separation techniques and their application to evaluate specific chemical components are an important aspect which permits accurate characterization and quantification. In addition, the develop‐ ment of appropriate analytical methods for chemotaxonomic studies has provided valu‐ able information to confirm specific plant identity. Importantly, these methods are also required for the quality control of plant material used to manufacture complementary and traditional medicines containing Sceletium. ",

In particular, with respect to the Sceletium plant species which contain closely related mesem‐ brine‐type compounds of which some are epimers and have isobaric chemistries [17], specific methods are necessary. Since HPLC using UV detection cannot discriminate between such compounds, detection by MS enhances the accuracy and specificity of the analytical method, thereby reducing the risk of using an inappropriate Sceletium species for the indications on the product label [22]. In addition, this method proved valuable to monitor the fermentation process of Sceletium plant material [24]. Hence, the current qualitative LCMS method, and concurrent application of the previously reported quantitative assay method [22], provides valuable analytical procedures for the identification and QC of Sceletium plant material and its dosage forms. The application of the LC‐ESI‐MS tandem mass spectroscopy provides unique fragmentation patterns which facilitates the identity of specific alkaloid in complex matrices and thus provides valuable confirmatory data for chemotaxonomic studies [11].

Based on this perception, Sceletium plants and their products are marketed with claimed improve‐ ments in mood and reduction of anxiety, when the fermented plant material is used either by chewing or smoking. In general, the fermentation process involves crushing the whole plant material or aerial parts which are then placed in sealed containers for several days and dried under natural sunlight.

It can be gleaned from current scientific literature that several scientific groups working on various aspects of Sceletium plants have focused on the biological activity of these alkaloids [29]. It should be noted that antidepressant activity of mesembrine‐type alkaloids has been demonstrated in animal models, of which, where mesembrine has been the principal alkaloid. The antidepressant activity is reportedly based on selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and mesembrine has a weak narcotic effect [30]. A recent study indicates that high‐ mesembrine Sceletium extract is a monoamine releasing agent, rather than only a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [31]. Zembrin® a marketed product containing a standardized extract of Sceletium tortuosum has been studied using human volunteers for its acute effects in the brain, and its pharmacological activity and potential therapeutic effect are reported to be based on the inhibiting reuptake of 5‐HT and PDE4.
