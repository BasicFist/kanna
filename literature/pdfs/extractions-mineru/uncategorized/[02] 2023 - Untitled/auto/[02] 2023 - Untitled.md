# Abstract

This chapter focuses on reviewing publications on medicinal plants used in the treatment of common diseases such as malaria, cholera, pneumonia, tuberculosis and asthma. Traditional medicine is still recognized as the preferred primary health care system in many rural communities, due to a number of reasons including affordability and effectiveness. The review concentrated on current literature on medicinal plants, highlighting on information about ethnobotany, phytochemistry and pharmacology. The search for publications on medicinal plants with scientifically proven efficacy was carried out using electronic databases such as Science Direct, Google Scholar, SciFinder and PubMed. In all, about 46 species of different families with potent biological and pharmacological activities were reviewed. All the plants reviewed exhibited potent activity confirming their various traditional uses and their ability to treat prevalent diseases.

Keywords: medicinal plants, malaria, diarrhea, tuberculosis, asthma

# 1. Introduction

Traditional medicine is still recognized as the preferred primary health care system in many communities, with over 60% of the world’s population and about 80% in developing countries depending directly on medicinal plants for their medical purposes [1]. This is due to a number of reasons including affordability, accessibility and low cost [2].

The use of plants to cure several kinds of human diseases has a long history. Various parts of plants such as leaf, stem, bark, root, etc. are being used to prevent, allay symptoms or revert abnormalities back to normal. Since the practice of “herbal remedies” does not adhere strictly to facts accrued using scientific approaches, orthodox medicine sees “herbal medicines” as an alternative medicine. However, most of the pharmaceutical products currently dispensed by physicians have a long history of use as herbal remedies, including opium, aspirin, digitalis and quinine. Modern medicine today utilizes active compounds isolated from higher plants, and about 80% of these active ingredients indicate a positive correlation between their modern therapeutic use and the traditional uses [3].

The search for, and use of drugs and dietary supplements obtained from plants have increased in recent years. Scientist such as pharmacologists, microbiologists, botanists, and phytochemists are combing the Earth for phytochemicals and clues that could be developed into medicines for various diseases treatment. This study therefore reviewed electronic database (Google Scholar, SciFinder, PubMed, etc.) for medicinal plants that have potent activity in treating some prevalent and common ailments like malaria, diarrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia and asthma.

# 2. Medicinal plants with demonstrated anti-malarial activity

Malaria is one of the world’s most important parasitic disease and a leading cause of death especially in developing countries [4]. It is endemic in about 100 developing countries, leading to about 1.2 million estimated deaths each year in Africa [5], with pregnant women and children below 5 years being mostly affected [6]. A wide range of medicinal plants is employed for the treatment of malaria, since majority of the people who get infected cannot afford the existing expensive orthodox medicines [7]. The problem of resistance to existing antimalarial agents by parasite has necessitated the search for new and potent agents, and the focus of researchers is on natural products especially medicinal plants since active compounds like quinine and artemisinin were isolated from plants and have been lead compounds for antimalarial drug development [8, 9]. Various medicinal plants have been investigated for their anti-malarial activity and some with demonstrated potent in vitro activity have been reviewed below.

# 2.1 Cryptolepis sanguinolenta

C. sanguinolenta (Lindl.) Schlechter (Apocynaceae) is known by Ghanaians as ‘Ghana quinine’ and specifically by the Asantes and Ewes as ‘Nibima’ and ‘Kadze,’ respectively [10]. It is a twining and scrambling thin-stemmed shrub, indigenous to Africa, with much ethno-medicinal importance and interest in the West African sub-region [11]. It is used traditionally for the treatment of malaria, upper respiratory and urinary tract infections, diarrhea, hypertension and as cicatrizant of wounds [12, 13]. The ethanolic and aqueous extracts of C. sanguinolenta exhibited an in vitro antiplasmodial activity against multi-drug resistance Plasmodium falciparum (K1) strain, with all the extracts inhibiting 90% of parasite growth at concentrations below 23 μg/mL. The ethanolic roots and leaves extracts showed potent activity with IC50 of 0.895 ± 0.02 and 3.01 ± 0.02 μg/mL, respectively. While the aqueous roots and leaves extracts had IC50 of 2.32 ± 0.3 and 13.5 ± 0.7 μg/mL, respectively [14]. Evaluating the clinical efficacy of a tea bag formulation of the root of C. sanguinolenta in patients with uncomplicated malaria showed that within 72 h, Fifty percent (50%) of the patients had their P. falciparum parasitaemia cleared, and all patients, by Day 7. By Day 3, all presenting symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea and vomiting were completely no more. The overall cure rate when one tea bag of C. sanguinolenta was taken three times a day for 5 days was 93.5%, due to two cases of recrudescence on Days 21 and 28 [15].

# 3. Medicinal plants with demonstrated activity against Vibrio cholera

Cholera is an acute intestinal disease caused by a facultative anaerobic, Gramnegative, comma-shaped rod bacterium, known as V. cholerae. Cholera is a life threatening disease transmitted by the fecal-oral route. The organisms adhere to and colonize the small bowel within a short incubation period, where they secrete cholera enterotoxin leading to severe and watery diarrhea accompanied with vomiting, dehydration and eventually death if not treated promptly [37]. Various antibiotics have been effective for the treatment of cholera; however, the worldwide problem of microbial resistance to existing antimicrobial medicines has led to most antibiotic failure. Researchers are therefore shifting their focus to natural products, especially medicinal plant, with effective antimicrobial properties. Some medicinal plants with potent anti-cholera activity are reviewed below.

In Africa, it is distributed in Nigeria, from eastern part of Sudan to Somalia and south through DR Congo and East Africa to Southern Africa. It also occurs in South-East Asia, India, Oceania and widely in the Indian Ocean islands. Traditionally, it is used as an antifungal and antibacterial agent for both human and plant pathogens. It is also used as an expectorant to treat pneumonia and asthma [33]. The in-vitro study of the aqueous leave extract of A. indica against MDR isolate DKU-156, JAL-1236 and sensitive M. tuberculosis H37Rv, demonstrated 95, 68 and 68% inhibition, respectively [62].

# 5. Medicinal plants with demonstrated activity against pneumonia

Pneumonia is a respiratory tract infection characterized by the inflammation of one or both lungs as a results of the accumulation of pus in the alveoli. Pneumonia which can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi can be mild, severe or life threatening. Bacterial pneumonia can be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae which is the commonest cause, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydophila pneumonia and Legionella pneumophila. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a fungal pneumonia commonly found in immunocompromised patients. Viral pneumonia can also be caused by adenovirus, Varicella zoster, Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus [64, 65]. Traditionally, medicinal plants have been employed for treating pneumonia and hence the need to prove, scientifically, their folkloric uses. Researchers have investigated such plant, and below is a review on some of the reported plants with demonstrated activity.

# 5.1 Echinops adenocaulos

In Ethiopian herbal medicine, members of the genus Echinops from family Asteraceae are used for the treatment of diarrhea, intestinal worm infestation, hemorrhoids, migraine and different forms of infections [66]. Zamzam water extract of E. adenocaulos demonstrated an antibacterial activity against multidrug resistance S. pneumoniae with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.781 mg/mL [67].

# 5.2 Verbascum fruticulosum

Various species of Verbascum, of the family Scrophulariaceae, have been used to treat pulmonary diseases in traditional medicine as a results of its antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus [68]. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of aqueous extract of V. fruticulosum against multidrug resistant clinical isolate of S. pneumoniae showed a high antibacterial activity with MIC value of 0.195 mg/mL [67].

# 5.3 Parietaria judaica

P. judaica commonly known as pellitory of wall from family Urticaceae has been valued for its use as a diuretic, balm for wounds and burns and also as a soother for chronic cough in herbal medicine [69]. The micro-broth dilution method was used to study the inhibitory activity of aqueous extract of P. Judaica. The extract was able to inhibit multidrug resistant S. pneumonia at an MIC value of 3.125 mg/mL [67].

# 5.4 Urtica urens

U. urens commonly known as dwarf nettle or annual nettle from family Urticaceae is used medicinally for the treatment of pulmonary diseases [70]. A study by Saleh Fares et al. [67] on the inhibitory activity of the aqueous extract of this plant against multidrug resistant clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae, using micro-broth dilution method, gave an MIC of 6.25 mg/mL. This illustrates its potential to be used as medicine in the treatment pneumonia caused by multidrug resistant S. pneumoniae.

# 5.5 Beta vulgaris

B. vulgaris popularly known as sugar beet from family Amaranthaceae is a sugar producing plant. Sugar-producing plants contain bioactive compounds, which are active against microbes and hence are able to protect the sugar from fermenting or from undergoing any alteration [71]. The study of the antimicrobial activity of the crude ethanolic leaf (lamina and midrib) extracts as well as fractions (n-hexane and chloroform) against K. pneumonia, showed zones of growth inhibition at different concentrations tested. At 1 mg/12 μL, the lamina and midrib crude extracts recorded 19 and 9 mm inhibition zone. The chloroform lamina and midrib fraction recorded 12 and 14 mm at concentration 1 mg/6 μL, while at concentration 1 mg/12 μL, their inhibition zones were 15 and 20 mm, respectively. Also the n-hexane lamina and midrib fractions had 20 and 16 mm inhibition zones (1 mg/6 μL),while 36 and 32 mm zones of inhibition (1 mg/12 μL) were recorded, respectively [72].

# 6. Medicinal plants with demonstrated anti-asthmatic activity

Asthma is a complex inflammatory disease and congestive respiratory disorder brought about by airway narrowing. It symptoms may include episodic wheezing, cough and chest tightness resulting in airflow block. It leads to changes in the levels of eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, cytokines and other inflammatory cell products. There is increased prevalence worldwide especially in industrialized countries and among children with increased morbidity and mortality rate [73, 74]. Medicinal plants have been screened for properties that enhance their activity as anti-asthmatic agents, since current medications have adverse side effects. Few of such plants with demonstrated activity are reviewed below.

# 6.1 Curcuma longa

C. longa L. is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial flowering plant of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and requires temperatures between 20 and 30°C and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive. Methanolic extracts (curcumin-II at 200 mg/kg and

curcumin-I at 100 mg/kg) of the finger rhizomes of C. longa reduced significantly (P < 0.01) estimated white blood cells count in ovalbumin (OVA) sensitized Wistar rat models for both long and short term. At a higher dosage, curcumin-II (200 mg/kg) tends to protect intact mast cells from degranulation [3]. This suggests that curcumin can be used as complementary medicine in the treatment of Asthma.

# 6.2 Aerva lanata

A. lanata (L.) A. L. Juss. ex Schult (Amaranthaceae) is a perennial herb, frequently becoming more or less woody at the base. The stems can be erect to prostrate, sometimes scrambling or climbing into other plants for support. It is widespread in the tropics and subtropics of Africa through Asia to the Philippines and New Guinea. It is used traditionally for treating cough, sore throat, indigestion, wounds, and diabetics and as a vermifuge for children [75]. The ethanol extract of aerial parts of A. lanata at 100 μg/mL significantly (\*\*\*p < 0.01) exhibited percentage decreased contraction in the isolated goat tracheal chain preparation model. Also in clonidine induced mast cell degranulation, the extract at 30 and 60 mg/kg administered orally, showed percentage protection of 64.2 and 68.9%, respectively [76].

# 6.3 Cynodon dactylon

C. dactylon (L.) Pers, of the family Poaceae is a short-lived, prostrate, perennial grass. It is widely naturalized in the temperate to tropical zones of Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas. Its habitat is along roadsides and in exposed rocky or sandy sites. It use in traditional medicine to stop bleeding in minor injuries, for weak vision and eye disorders, piles, asthma, tumors among others [77]. The findings of Savali et al. [78], indicated that isolated C. dactylon compound was potent and has significant (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001) inhibitory effect on compound 48/80 induced anaphylactic reaction and mast cell activation. Also, compound 48/80 induced increased level of nitric oxide in rat serum and rat peritoneal mast cells were significantly inhibited.

# 6.4 Piper betle

P. betle L. (Piperaceae) commonly referred to as Betel pepper, is an evergreen climbing shrub producing woody stems, 5–20 m long, and distributed in Southeast Asia—probably originally from Malaysia. It is traditionally used to cure cough, cold, pruritis, asthma and rheumatism [79]. Ethanol and aqueous extract of leaves at doses 100 and 200 mg/kg possesses anti-asthmatic activity on histamine induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pig and histamine induced dose dependent contraction of guinea pig tracheal chain [80].

# 6.5 Lepidium sativum

L. sativum L. (Brassicaceae) also referred to as Garden cress is a profuselybranched, erect, annual plant growing up to 80 cm tall [81]. It commonly grown in many regions of Saudi Arabia and the Eastern Province. The seeds are used to cure bronchitis, asthma, cough, and useful as abortifacient, antibacterial, aphrodisiac, diuretic, expectorant, gastrointestinal stimulant, gastroprotective, laxative and

Medicinal Plants for Treatment of Prevalent Diseases DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.82049

stomachic [82]. The bronchodilatory effect of ethanolic seed extract and ethyl acetate, n-butanol and methanol fractions, against histamine and acetylcholine induced acute bronchospasm in guinea pigs, exhibited significant inhibition of bronchospasm, with n-butanol fraction showing a significant (p < 0.001) protection comparable to the reference standards used in the study [83]. Rehman et al. [84] also confirmed the bronchodilatory effect of L. sativum crude extract by investigating the various pathways for its activity in airway disorders. It was revealed that, the extract’s activity was mediated through a combination of anticholinergic, Ca++ antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitory pathways.

# 6.6 Curculigo orchioides

C. orchioides Gaertn. (Hypoxidaceae) is a stemless evergreen perennial herb producing a cluster of leaves from the roots and spreading to form a clump. It grows up to 50 cm tall. It ranges from East Asia—South China, Japan, Indian subcontinent, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, New Guinea, W. Pacific. Alcoholic extract of C. orchioides rhizomes at doses (100–400 mg/kg) shows mast cell stabilizing and antihistaminic activity on Compound 48/80-induced mast cell degranulation and systemic anaphylaxis [85]. Also Pandit et al. [86] established the usefulness of the ethanol extract in treating asthma, as it was reported to exhibit significant relaxant effect (p < 0.01) at concentrations 100 and 25 μg/mL in isolated goat tracheal chain and isolated guinea pig ileum preparations respectively. In an in vivo study using histamine induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs, egg albumin induced passive paw anaphylaxis in rats and haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice, there was significant (p < 0.01) protection at lower doses. Again, maximum increase in leucocytes and lymphocytes (99%) and maximum decrease in eosinophils up to 0% at dose 375 mg/kg p.o. was reported in milk-induced total leukocytes and differential leukocyte counts.

# 6.7 Casuarina equisetifolia

C. equisetifolia L. (Casuarinaceae) also commonly known as Common Ru, is an evergreen tree with a finely branched, feathery crown usually growing from 6 to 35 m and 20–100 cm in diameter. The tree is widely planted throughout the tropics, and ranges from East Asia to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia and the Pacific [87]. The methanol extract of wood and bark (10–80 mcg/mL) exhibited a significant dose dependent (p < 0.05) antihistaminic activity by inhibiting the histamine induced contraction of trachea. The wood extract (100 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced clonidine induced catalepsy (p < 0.05) and mast cell degranulation (p < 0.001) [88].

# 7. Conclusion

All the plants reviewed exhibited potent activity confirming their various traditional uses and their ability to treat prevalent diseases. There is therefore the need to subject these plants to further studies, by isolating active compounds which can be processed into new and potent medicines and the need to study their mechanisms of action.
