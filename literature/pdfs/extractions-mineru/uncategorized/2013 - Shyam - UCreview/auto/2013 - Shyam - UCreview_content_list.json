Chronic IBD may be divided into two major groups, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), clinically characterized by recurrent inflammatory involvement of intestinal segments with several manifestations often resulting in an unpredictable course1. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory chronic disease primarily affecting the colonic mucosa; the extent and severity of colon involvement are variable. In its most limited form it may be restricted to the distal rectum, while in its most extended form the entire colon is involved. However, 80% of the patients present with disease extending from the rectum to the splenic flexure, and only 20% have pancolitis . Although the causes of IBD remain unclear, considerable progress has been made recently in the identification of important pathophysiologic mechanisms, and further and newer knowledge has been obtained from recent studies concerning their epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis and treatment.

When the disease is active, the lamina propria of the mucosa becomes highly infiltrated with a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory cells. There is a predominant increase in mucosal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) production, evidence of complement activation, and activation of macrophages and T cells. This immunological activity is associated with the release of a vast array of cytokines, kinins, leukotriene, platelet activating factor (PAF) and reactive oxygen metabolites. These mediators not only serve to amplify the immune and inflammatory response, but they also have direct effects on epithelial function, on endothelial function (which may increase permeability and lead to ischemia), and on repair mechanisms, thus increasing collagen synthesis. In addition, many of the cytokines (interleukins 1 and 6, tumour necrosis factor) will activate an acute phase response, resulting in fever and a rise in serum acute phase proteins5,6,7. ",
