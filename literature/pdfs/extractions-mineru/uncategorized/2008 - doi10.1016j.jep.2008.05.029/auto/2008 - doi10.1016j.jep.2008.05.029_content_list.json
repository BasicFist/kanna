        "text": "Africa, and especially southern Africa, has a rich diversity of plants. Recent statistics show that about 25% of the total number of higher plants in the world is found in Africa south of the Sahara. According to the “African Plant Checklist and Database Project” (Klopper et al., 2006), a total of 50,136 angiosperm taxa occur in tropical Africa and southern Africa. This figure is based on a recent merging of two major data bases—EPFAT (Enumération des plantes à fleurs d’Afrique) and FSA (Flora of southern Africa). The combined checklist shows a total of 32,424 taxa in tropical Africa and 22,755 taxa in southern Africa. A useful reference book on the medicinal plants of the whole of the African continent (Neuwinger, 2000) lists more than 5400 medicinal plant taxa and over 16,300 medicinal uses. It is generally accepted (e.g. Geldenhuys and Van Wyk, 2002) that natural resources will play a major role in the socioeconomic development of the African continent. The angiosperm species count for southern Africa (Germishuizen and Meyer, 2003) is 21,817 and the count for the Cape Floristic Region (Goldblatt and Manning, 2001) is 8888. Van Wyk and Gericke (2000) estimated that about 3000 medicinal plants are regularly used in southern Africa. An annotated checklist of traditional medicinal plants of southern Africa (Arnold et al., 2002) gives a total of 3481 plant taxa, of which 2942 are administered to people only. Basic information about the most widely used species can be found in Van Wyk et al. (1997), Van Wyk and Gericke (2000) and Diederichs (2006). This diversity represents a very valuable resource, not only for commercial development but also for basic scientific study. ",

        "text": "Of the estimated 3000 medicinal plant species that are regularly used in traditional medicine in South Africa, only about 38 indigenous species have been commercialized to some extent (i.e. they are available as processed materials in modern packaging and in various dosage forms as teas, tinctures, tablets, capsules or ointments). Several others are also produced for multi-million Rand informal markets (Cunningham, 1988; Mander, 1998; Williams et al., 2000). A useful review of various aspects of the commercialization process in South Africa is given by Diederichs (2006). The major commercialized species are listed in Table 1, together with basic ethnobotanical information and some key references. The list includes indigenous species that are widely distributed in Africa and that have been extensively commercialized in other parts of Africa and/or in other parts of the world (e.g. Adansonia digitata, Centella asiatica, Kigelia africana, Prunus africana and Trichilia emetica). Also included are two famous and popular herbs of Ayurvedic medicine that have hitherto been of limited commercial interest in South Africa (Centella asiatica and Withania somnifera). Wildharvested material of Merwilla plumbea (Lindl.) Speta (syn. Scilla natalensis Planch.), Bowiea volubilis Harv. ex Hook.f. and several other important medicinal plant species is traded in large volumes on local markets but have as yet only been formally commercialized to a limited extent. Several of the plants listed in Table 1 are endemic to southern Africa and some of them are treated in detailed reviews in this volume. ",

        "text": "In order to gain some insight into the scientific and/or commercial interest in South African medicinal plants, a literature search was conducted with the well-known Scopus literature reference system maintained by Elsevier. Using the scientific names of the species and the “quick search” option, varying numbers of “hits” were obtained for those species listed in Table 1. The searches were carefully executed to include main synonyms and other commercial species of the same genus where relevant (e.g. Cyclopia). The results are summarized in Table 2, which outlines the number of scientific publications and the number of citation in patents in recent years. The general trend is one of an increasing number of papers and citations since 1995, although this is not true for all the species. The popularity of Centella asiatica and Withania somnifera in Ayurvedic medicine is reflected in the large number of citations and publications over many years. Relatively large numbers are also seen for those species that are well established in tropical Africa as important medicinal plants (e.g. Adansonia digitata, Kigelia africana and Prunus africana). These species have been of limited commercial interest in South Africa despite their popularity elsewhere. ",

        "text": "Table 2 reveals a rapid increase in the number of publications and patent citations for several indigenous species that were scientifically practically unknown and unstudied prior to 1995. Raw material of some species has only become available in commercial quantities in recent years, so that the number of ethnopharmacological studies has sharply increased since 1995. This trend was discussed by Light et al. (2005, and references cited therein) and is also reflected in review papers in this volume. In several cases, the number of scientific papers published since 2006 (i.e., a period of just over 2 years) already exceed those published in the preceding 5-year periods of 1995–2000 and 2001–2005. Notable examples are Cyclopia genistoides, Euclea natalensis, Hoodia gordonii, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Pelargonium sidoides and Sutherlandia frutescens. Rapid recent increases in the number of patent citations are also evident, especially for Adansonia, Aspalathus, Cyclopia, Harpagophytum, Hoodia, Mesembryanthemum, Pelargonium and Sutherlandia. Well-known commercialized species such as Harpagophytum procumbens and Aloe ferox has been the subject of scientific investigation over many years. The decreasing trend in Mesembryanthemum tortuosum is due an early interest in the unique alkaloids of these plants and a rather slow pace of commercialization. Recent research and development activity is also reflected in the data for some well-established commercial species, including Aspalathus linearis and Xysmalobium undulatum (both of which were first commercialized more than 100 years ago).

The bitter latex, tapped from the leaves by a traditional method and exported to Europe since 1761 (Marloth, 1915; Kruger and Beyers, 1977; Robertson, 1979; Forbes, 1986), is known commercially as “Cape aloes”. It has a long history of use in Africa and Europe as laxative medicine and is considered to have bitter tonic, anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory properties (Newall et al., 1996; Blumenthal et al., 1998; Wichtl and Bisset, 2000; ESCOP, 2003). The laxative effect is due to anthroneC-glycosides, of which aloin (syn. barbaloin) is the main compound (Van Wyk et al., 1995). Aloin occurs in tapped and dried leaf juice of Aloe ferox (so-called “Cape aloes”) as a 1:1 mixture of aloin A and aloin B, at levels of about 10–28% dry weight (Van Wyk et al., 1995).

Aloe ferox gel differs substantially from that of Aloe vera L. (notably in the absence of acetylated sugars) but limited details are available (O’Brien, 2006; unpublished M.Sc. Thesis, University of Johannesburg). Only wildcrafted material is currently used, apparently without any damage to natural populations (Newton and Vaughan, 1996), but the situation may change if there is a strong increase in demand. It may be possible to develop selections and cultivars with superior growth and quality. Some genetic markers have been studied (Van der Bank et al., 1995a; Van der Bank and Van Wyk, 1996); markers such as RFPL, applied to gel identification of Aloe species by Shioda et al.

In rats, a low chronic toxicity potential was demonstrated over a period of 3 months, with daily doses of 0.1 and 1.0 g/kg of aqueous extract. The chemotype of Artemisia and the level of thujone were not recorded. In humans, high doses of thujone can cause confusion, convulsions and coma but selected chemotypes (especially low thujone clones) are already grown on a small scale.

Some species and populations are resprouters (they survive fire and sprout from the woody base) while others are reseeders—they are killed by fire and re-establish from seed. The seed physiology and seed germination of Cyclopia have been studied in detail (Sutcliffe and Whitehead, 1995; Whitehead and Sutcliffe, 1995) and some of the principles are already applied in commercial propagation. The phenolic constituents of honeybush tea were first studied by De Nysschen et al. (1996), who identified mangiferin and two flavonoids as the main compounds in practically all the species. Further work by Ferreira et al. (1998) described the total phenolic complexity in more detail, including the polyphenols in Cyclopia intermedia (Kamara et al., 2003).

Chemical variation at population level should be studied over the entire distribution range of the various taxa. Several studies have focused on the sustainability of harvesting and propagation methods but a deeper understanding of the autecology and reproductive biology of Harpagophytum species will be of considerable value as a source of basic information to guide ongoing crop development and propagation protocols.

At the generic level, the relationships and age of basal lineages within the family (and specifically the subfamily Mesembryanthemoideae) have been reported by Klak et al. (2004). A recent study has shown that the entire subfamily represents a single genus (Klak et al., 2007) and all the existing genera were formally subsumed under the genus Mesembryanthemum. A survey of alkaloids in the family (Smith et al., 1996a; Gaffney, 2006) showed that several genera and species produce alkaloids. The species of commercial interest is Mesembryanthemum tortuosum, a highly variable plant with a wide distribution range (Gerbaulet, 1996). It differs from the seven close relatives in having straight secondary veins, prominent idioblasts, incurved leaf tips and imbricate leaves (Gerbaulet, 1996). Variation studies in our laboratory has shown that some populations of Mesembryanthemum tortuosum are practically devoid of mesembrine-type alkaloids, while others have high yields of up to 2.4% of dry weight. As with so many African plants, the full morphological, chemical and genetic diversity of the species remains unknown, despite commercial interests.

There is a need for taxonomic and systematic studies of the plants and their relatives in order to better understand the full genetic and metabolic diversity at population and clonal levels, ethnobotanical studies to document and explore the socio-cultural context of the medicinal plants, chemical studies to identify the active chemical compounds or marker compounds, pharmacological studies to determine the mode of action, horticultural or autecological studies to find out if the plants are suitable for large-scale production or sustainable harvesting and finally, studies of the reproductive biology of the plants to develop propagation protocols and to guide crop development.
