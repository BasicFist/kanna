To avoid recent additions and modern cultural influences in the results, the date of publication of the last volume of Marloth’s Flora of South Africa (1932) was chosen as a cut-off date. Results: The recorded Cape materia medica (up to 1932) is briefly summarized, giving the scientific names, vernacular names (in Afrikaans or Khoi-San/Nama) and main uses. It comprises about 170 items and includes mainly indigenous and endemic plant species, some exotic (garden) plants, and a few other items (fungi, seaweeds, lichens, hyraceum and natural potassium nitrate). Most of the plants (and hyraceum) are still widely used today, especially in rural areas.   \nConclusions: The combination of unique cultural practices and a diverse, highly endemic flora has led to the development of a distinct herbal healing system, here called Cape herbal medicine, but hitherto rather vaguely and inaccurately referred to as Khoi-San medicine, Cape Dutch medicine or boererate (farm remedies). The data allows for a more informed consideration of indigenous knowledge and intellectual property rights associated with particular plants (e.g. Hoodia and Pelargonium). It also offers opportunities for linking modern ethnobotanical field studies with historical data. ",

The relatively small area of 90,000 km2 has a total of about 9000 indigenous plant species, of which almost 69% are endemic (Goldblatt and Manning, 2000). The region is also part of the traditional home of Khoikhoi or Khoekhoe (Hottentot) herders, and San (Bushman) hunter–gatherers (Shapera, 1930; Boonzaier et al., 1996). These highly diverse cultural groups are sometimes collectively and simplistically referred to as the Khoi-San people. In the second half of the 17th century, the region became inhabited by Europeans, mainly of Dutch, German and French descent. Through geographical isolation, these people developed into a cultural group known as the Cape Dutch and later as Cape Afrikaners. The interactions between Khoi-San and Cape Dutch peoples also resulted in a distinct but poorly studied healing culture, known as Khoi-San or Cape Dutch medicine. The diverse flora of the region, with its high level of endemism, contributed greatly towards the uniqueness of the materia medica. ",

There are numerous publications on the San (Bushman) of the Kalahari (Tobias, 1960, 1975) but the emphasis has been on plants used for food and water (Story, 1958, 1964), utility items (Tanaka, 1978) or hunting poisons (Neuwinger, 1994, 1996). Medicinal plants and their uses have remained poorly known despite recent books by Von Koenen (1996, 2001) and Van Wyk and Gericke (2000), both of which contain summaries of available information from Namibia and Botswana. Examples of other detailed studies in Namibia are those of Malan and Owen-Smith (1974) for Kaokoland, Heinz and Maguire (1974) for the !Ko Bushmen, Steyn (1981) on !Nharo plant utilization, and Dentlinger (1977) and Van den Eynden et al.

        "text": "In the Cape region of South Africa, the early Dutch settlers introduced some medicinal plants from Europe but started using the local plants. In this way, a unique medicinal culture developed that has been referred to as Cape Dutch medicine. Since the turn of the 19th century, the term Cape Dutch was no longer appropriate, as the Afrikaans language and culture (developed mainly from Dutch, French, German, Khoikhoi, San and Malay) became separate entities in their own right. Unfortunately, few of the original Khoikhoi and San names have survived (see later), so that the majority of Cape medicinal plants have Afrikaans (Cape Dutch) names. However, the term “Cape Dutch medicine” does not adequately reflect the Khoi-San origins of most of the remedies, so that “Cape herbal medicine” will be used in this review. It seems surprising that Cape herbal medicine is so poorly studied, considering the exceptionally rich botanical diversity and especially the high levels of endemism. Added to this biological diversity is also a rich indigenous cultural diversity that has unfortunately been equally poorly recorded. ",

These sources contain numerous references to the indigenous materia medica of South or southern Africa, but early books dedicated entirely to the subject of medicinal plants are limited to those of Pappe (1847, 1850, 1857), Smith (1895) and Kling (1923). The classic work of Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962) summarises most of the early literature for southern and eastern Africa. The dictionary of common names of Smith (1966) is also a rich source of ethnobotanical information. The medicinal plants of the Cape region have rarely been treated as an entity on their own (see later). It should be noted that many of the Cape plants and their uses are described in books on South African herbal medicine, such as Anonymous (1962), Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), Palmer (1985), Roberts (1990), Rood (1994), Shearing and Van Heerden (1994), Van Wyk et al. (1997) and Arnold et al. (2002). The origin of the information or the place where it was recorded for the first time is hardly ever given. As pointed out by Scott and Hewett (2008), such information may be important in the context of intellectual property rights and claimed ownership of indigenous knowledge. ",

The aim is to critically analyse and interpret published and some unpublished information on the medicinal plants of Khoikhoi, San and Cape Dutch origin. In order to exclude recent influences that may have distorted the historical authenticity of the materia medica, the publication of the last volume of the Flora of South Africa by Marloth (1932) was chosen as a cut-off date. Marloth was a trained pharmacist with an interest in the medicinal uses of South African plants, so that his books contain several original anecdotes. The aim was therefore to contribute towards conceptualising Cape herbal medicine as a distinct healing system and to provide an historically accurate synthesis of medicinal plants (with their vernacular names), so that modern ethnobotanical field studies can be linked to historical data.

A systematic scrutiny of the old literature may yield useful additional information.

Diviners are still encountered in remote regions of the Kalahari and are often female. In many parts of the Cape, the herbalist is still referred to as the bossiedokter (a doctor that uses herbs or small bushes – “bossies” – to heal). Although many people have a sound knowledge of herbs and use them regularly, the term bossiedokter is a designation of honour, reserved for highly skilled and experienced herbalists. ",

A large part of the plant lore revolved around snake bite remedies but many of them have become obscure in modern times. Snake doctors daily ingested small doses of snake poison to make them immune against snake bite and perhaps to symbolically gain power over the snake. The treatment of snake or scorpion bites involved scarification of the wound and the application of specific plants, both topically as poultice and orally as infusion or decoction (Smith, 1895; Laidler, 1928). In addition to herbs such as dagga or wilde dagga—Leonotis leonurus (L.) R.Br., the crushed snake head or scorpion were also applied to the bite. ",

There are strong beliefs relating to the inappropriate use of plants—for example, the use of a “female plant” by a man may result in impotence or sterility. Leaf powders (buchu) that are mixed with fat and used as ointments are often classified as male or female. This interesting aspect is poorly recorded and deserves further study. ",

Massage (Nama: !kouroe) took different forms (Laidler, 1928). Fat was rubbed into an area where pain was felt and the diviner may have passed his or her hands over the spot (to add magic to the medicine). The stomach was massaged by rolling movements of the hand in cases of amenorrhoea or infertility. !Kouroe also took the form of punching and kneading when pains or sprains were attended to. Another method (!koo) used the hand to gently transfer heat from the fire onto an affected part of the body. ",

It is claimed by Smith (1966) that the Khoi referred to the San or Sanqua (Sonqua) as the “men or people (qua) who anointed their bodies with bushes (son, san)”, because of their habit of massaging with powdered aromatic bushes mixed with sheep fat. This habit was witnessed by my father in the Calvinia district (farm Klipwerf), at a time (ca. 1935) when there were still semi-nomadic San who regularly came around for meat and fat leftovers from the communal cooking shed. The name Son (plural San) referred to one of the preferred plants, Pteronia onobromoides DC., the powdered leaves of which were carried in a special tortoise shell container. The name Sonqua therefore directly translates to “bossieman”, which became boesman and bushman. “Bossies” (small shrubs) are an integral part of the culture, ideom and language of the Karoo and Renosterveld regions, where this life form is dominant in the vegetation.

        "text": "Dosage forms that have been accurately recorded include masticatories, infusions (in water), decoctions (in water or often in milk), tinctures, poultices and snuffs. The three best-known masticatories are kanna or kougoed (Mesembryanthemum tortuosum L. and related species), bosjesmansthee [Catha edulis (Vahl.) Endl.] (Pappe, 1847) and ghaap (Hoodia species and various other succulent stapeliads). I first witnessed (in the Calvinia district in 1968) the eating of “ghaap” to suppress hunger. The earliest explicit record of “ghaap” being eaten to suppress hunger is that of Marloth (1932). In his discussion of Hoodia pilifera (L.f.) Plowes, Marloth (1932, p. 94) states: “This is the real ghaap of the natives, who use it as a substitute for food and water when both are scarce. The sweet sap reminds one of liquorice and, when on one occasion thirst compelled me to follow the example of my Hottentot guide, it saved further suffering and removed the pangs of hunger so efficiently that I could not eat anything for a day after having reached the camp.” The use of milk to prepare decoctions of red (tannin-rich) tuberous roots [Pelargonium antidysentericum (Eckl. & Zeyh.) Kostel.] is also of special interest, as the interaction between the tannins in the roots and the milk proteins undoubtedly alters the physical and chemical properties of the medicine when compared to using only water. [Detailed ethnobotanical data on Pelargonium sidoides and other species are presented elsewhere in this issue.] Mother’s milk or saliva was commonly employed for medicine given to infants. Selfmedication by taking an infusion (tea, tee) of a wide range of plants is still popular in rural areas. In an interview in 1994, the legendary “Lappiesman” (Jan Schoeman) of the Prince Albert district in the Karoo (depicted in Oberholzer, 2002) ascribed his exceptional fitness at an advanced age to a daily (early morning) cup of litjiestee made from Viscum capense L.f. Tinctures appear to be a more recent (Cape Dutch) introduction, as only low-alcohol beverages (karrie or honey beer) were traditionally available. Brandy (brandewyn) and other forms of distilled alcohol (witblits) were readily available at the Cape, especially in wine-producing districts (Dykman, 1908; Cillié, 1992). Poultices are still popular, not only to treat wounds, burns and other skin ailments but also to alleviate headache and localized pain. Laidler (1928) and Archer (1990) mention the use of snuffs and the principle that sneezing is thought to “expel” the disease or ailment. Dried and powdered root of Gomphocarpus cancellatus (Burm.f.) Bruyns is one such medicinal snuff for treating influenza (Archer, 1990) and may be the same plant (or a relative) of the witvergeet (witte vergeit) of Laidler (1928). Few accurate details of the use of snuffs have been recorded. A comprehensive account of the traditional concepts of diseases and their treatments are beyond the scope of this review. In some of the early documents (Smith, 1895; Dykman, 1908; Kling, 1923) ailments were used as the main categories for arranging the medicinal plants species that were recorded. An interesting insight into common ailments and therapies of the Nama people is provided by Laidler (1928). ",

Typical for the rock hyrax or rock rabbit is its highly concentrated urine (an adaptation to survive in arid regions) that is deposited in localized sites in rock crevices. The animal is also able to survive on aromatic and resinous plant materials, so that the concretion of the urine (a blackish, tar-like substance) has a strong, aromatic and musky smell. Hyraceum may become fossilized with age and is chemically complex and variable (Olsen et al., 2008). Laidler (1928) recorded the Nama names //am uru or /gaous (// = lateral click, / = dental click) and the Afrikaans name swart bo meester (big black master). The product may gradually be converted (through the action of rain and air) into white potassium nitrate, which is called bo meester (grand big master) or klipsweet (rock sweat). The term klipsweet is also used for the excretions of midgets that are gathered from rocks (for medicinal use). Potassium nitrate (saltpeter) has been used in European traditional medicine as a diuretic, antipyretic and asthma medicine (Burger and Wachter, 1998). Hyraceum is used as an antispasmodic for stiffness in the back, back pain, stomach pain, hysteria, epilepsy and all nervous conditions (Pappe, 1847; Dykman, 1908; Kling, 1923; Laidler, 1928). It is interesting to note that some samples have shown GABAbenzodiazepine receptor activity (Olsen et al., 2008). Decoctions and infusions are taken orally as an antidote for any type of poisoning and the product is rubbed into scarified snake bites and scorpion stings. As a tea, it is used to treat women’s ailments but large doses are said to result in abortion (Laidler, 1928). ",

Rhus lancea L.f.), Massonia jasminiflora Burch. ex Baker, Boophone disticha (L.f.) Herb (Wilman, 1968) as well as Aloe ferox Mill. and Aloe broomii Schönland (Reynolds, 1950). The cultural importance and medicinal value of these plants are still evident today. Most of them (including Harpagophytum procumbens) are important medicinal plants but they are not part of the Cape healing culture (see Table 1) and are therefore not discussed in detail here. Boophone disticha is a hallucinogenic plant of special interest in Khoi-San ethnomedicine and appears to symbolise eternal life. Boophone alkaloids demonstrate serotonin activity (Sandager et al., 2005). Personal observations in the Kalahari Desert strongly suggest that Boophone disticha is of importance in the trance dance or kia healing ritual, even though it is not mentioned in the literature on this subject (Dobkin de Rios, 1986; Winkelman and Dobkin de Rios, 1989). This plant deserves further study, as it is now known to be of importance in Khoi mummification. The discovery in the Kouga/Baviaanskloof area of a Khoi-San mummy (of a man) is of special interest (Binneman, 1999). The body was mummified with Boophone disticha bulb scales and was buried nearly 2000 (1930 ± 20) years ago. ",

        "text": "The emphasis of this review is on herbal remedies of the Cape (i.e., the Cape fynbos area and adjacent Karoo regions) that have been accurately recorded up to 1932. One of the major problems in interpreting the fragmented early records is the fact that vernacular names are given in the Khoi language or mostly in Afrikaans, or a mixture of the two. ",

        "text": "Important contributions were made by botanical explorers during the Dutch era (Scott and Hewett, 2008), notably the Swedish botanist, C.P. Thunberg. The first detailed account of Cape herbal medicine was published by Pappe (1847, 1850, 1857). Other important sources of information are Smith (1888, 1895), Dykman (1891, 1908), Marloth (1913–1932), Kling (1923) and Laidler (1928). Pappe (1847) was the first to give an extensive list of “Cape Dutch” plant uses, mainly focussed on the immediate surrounds of Cape Town. The information in Dykman (1891, 1908) is of special interest, as it represents a compilation of Cape farm remedies (boererate) collected as recipes from (now obscure) popular literature and unpublished anecdotes over a period of many years. Herbs were mostly used in mixtures and all plant names were given in Afrikaans only. It is important to note the high incidence of plant combinations in the recommended treatments of Dykman (1908). Such mixtures, with their potential value to produce additive or even synergistic effects (Viljoen et al., 2003), have hardly received any scientific attention until recently. Kling (1923) was based in the town of Tulbagh, so his review (also in Afrikaans) is restricted to Cape plants. The various Flora volumes of Marloth (1913–1932) are more accessible (in English) and have a much wider coverage, both geographically and taxonomically. Laidler (1928) gives important insights into traditional medicine in Namaqualand but several of the plants were not accurately identified. The work of Archer (1990, 1994) also made an important contribution for Namaqualand. Additional information exists for the Nieuwoudtville area and the Clanwilliam–Citrusdal districts (Metelerkamp and Sealy, 1983; Van Wyk et al., unpublished). For the area known as the Little Karoo (Kannaland), valuable information has been collected by the Kleinplasie Farm Museum at Worcester (Cillié, 1992; Vergoes Houwens, undated; Wileman, undated) and the Montagu Museum (Montagu Museum, 1998). Medicinal plant uses in the Karoo are mentioned by Shearing and Van Heerden (1994). Thring and Weitz (2006) made an important contribution for the Bredasdorp/Elim region, known as the Southern Overberg. Smith (1888, 1895) provided a scientifically accurate review of plant uses in the Grahamstown region of the Eastern Cape Province, which is supplemented by the recent review of Matsiliza and Barker (2001). Since Smith (1895) usually distinguished between Khoikhoi and Xhosa (Nguni) plant uses, it was possible to restrict the entries in Table 1 to the former. A recent survey of medicinal plant use in the Murraysburg and Graaff–Reinet districts of the eastern Karoo (Van Wyk et al., 2008) has also helped to interpret the information given by Smith (1895).

        "text": "A total of about 170 plant species has been recorded from the Cape region up to 1932 (Table 1). Table 1 gives the currently accepted scientific names (following Germishuizen and Meyer, 2003), as well as the original vernacular names in Afrikaans and/or Khoi/Nama. For older synonyms, Germishuizen and Meyer (2003) should be consulted, while Smith (1966) and Powrie (2004) are useful sources of information on vernacular names. The information in Table 1 is of value in comparing current plant use patterns in the Cape region with the historical record. The following five broad and partly overlapping categories of species can be distinguished in Table 1 (these are indicated in square brackets in column 1), namely 1, Cape-endemic plants that are still in everyday use by rural communities in the Cape region; 2, South African plants with a wide distribution that are also traditionally used in the Sotho and Nguni cultures. These include Aloe ferox, Artemisia afra, Boophone disticha, Bulbine species, Dodonaea angustifolia, Euclea species, Gunnera perpensa, Helichrysum species, Leonotis leonurus, Pelargonium sidoides, Sansevieria aethiopica, Sutherlandia frutescens, Teucrium species, Withania somniferum and Xysmalobium undulatium; 3, species of commercial importance or that are currently under development as new products. These include Agathosma betulina, Agathosma crenulata, ",

Many new records may be added, especially from isolated areas where no detailed or systematic studies have yet been conducted. However, there is very strong agreement between the list in Table 1 and the published lists of plants that are still currently used (Archer, 1990; Montagu Museum, 1998; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Van Wyk et al., 2008; see also Ferreira, 1987).

The Cape materia medica comprises mostly indigenous and Cape-endemic plant species, several cultivated or weedy (exotic) plants, together with a few fungi, lichens, seaweeds and animal products (mainly hyraceum and klipsweet). The data presented here allows for a more informed consideration of indigenous knowledge and intellectual property rights associated with particular plants (Hoodia and Pelargonium).
