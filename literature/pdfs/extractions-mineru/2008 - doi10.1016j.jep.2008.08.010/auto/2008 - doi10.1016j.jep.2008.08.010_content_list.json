The families most often represented are Fabaceae (15 species), Asteraceae (13 species) and Lamiaceae (9 species) (Table 1). Over 40 plant species are used for ailments that could be described as depression (Table 2). These plants come from 26 different families. The number of plants used for dementia and age-related mental problems are lower with only 15 species from 7 families recorded (Table 3), which could be due to a previous demographic situation, where traditional healers less frequently had very old patients. Amaryllidaceae is the best-represented family with six species (Table 3). Mental health problems constitute a serious problem in southern Africa. Not surprisingly, a large number, well over 300 species, of plants are used by traditional healers in their treatment of these ailments (Sobiecki, 2002). ",

A recent study reports an increased risk of dying and a greater proportion of deaths that are epilepsy-related in Africa – as high as a six-fold increase in mortality in people with epilepsy. This is higher than the two- to three-fold increase reported in developed countries (Christianson et al., 2000; Diop et al., 2005). The reasons for this gap between the developed and the developing countries are not entirely clear but suggestions have been made that it might be due to social deprivation (Sander, 2003). Interestingly, recent data suggest that people from socio-economically deprived backgrounds in developed countries are more likely to develop epilepsy (Heaney et al., 2002). A study from 2000 on the prevalence of epilepsy in a large rural community situated in the Northern Province in South Africa showed a lifetime prevalence in children as high as 73/1000 (Christianson et al., 2000).

It is viewed as a shameful disorder and has severe social implications in African communities as it carries a stigma.

Another group reported amentoflavone to be a relatively weak negative allosteric modulator of GABA action acting independently the flumazenil binding site (Hanrahan et al., 2003). Thus, the use of these plants as anticonvulsive agents suggests involvement of a different neurotransmitter system. Further functional characterization of the Searsia extracts showed inhibitory effects on spontaneous epileptiform discharges in mouse cortical slices (Pedersen et al., 2008). Interestingly, the effect was not caused by the previous isolated flavonoids. The extracts contained $N \\cdot$ -methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists, which might explain the effect of the plants reported by the traditional healers.

The variety of effects, the lack of selectivity, the need for functional assays and the mismatch between in vitro and in vivo findings make it at challenging task to examine these plants for potential new anti-epileptic drugs. So far, very few compounds have been isolated and characterized. Most of the studies are conduced on extracts and the mechanism of action might involve several different neurotransmitter systems. When used by the traditional healers, the medicinal plants are often combined thus increasing the potential number of neuroactive compounds in the pool of ingredients making the identification of active components very difficult.

Cultural attitudes in Africa surrounding dementia may have contributed to this apparent low prevalence. One suggestion is that dementia sufferers may not survive for long. They may die quickly, from conditions such as pneumonia or diarrhoea due to the decreasing status of the olderly in the developing world (Chandra et al., 1994; Levkoff et al., 1995). Another explanation is that dementia, like other kinds of mental illness, remains a stigmatised condition, and as such may be hidden from researchers (Ineichen, 2000). Given that rural communities still have difficulties in accessing tertiary health care and that memory impairment may be accepted as part of normal ageing, patients do not readily interface with clinicians (De Villiers and Louw, 1996). The demented may not even be seen as ill (De Villiers and Louw, 1996). Among the Tuareg of Niger, senility is believed to be a possible consequence of an old person neglecting her duty of regular prayer (Rasmussen, 1997).

Of the various possible strategies for enhancing cholinergic activity in the brain, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition has been by far the most extensively used (Weinstock, 1999). Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors enhance central cholinergic function by inhibiting the enzymes that degrade ACh, thereby increasing the availability of ACh to stimulate nicotinic and muscarinic receptors within the brain. Since their introduction into clinical practice, AChE inhibitors have been, and remain, the standard approach to the symptomatic treatment of AD.

Perhaps, the earliest records of toxic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors concern the perennial African plant Physostigma venenosum Balf. (Fabaceae). The seeds of this plant, indigenous to Calabar on the coast of Nigeria in West Africa, were used by local people for “trial by ordeal” to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused criminal. The alkaloid, physostigmine, was first isolated from Physostigma venenosum seeds in 1864 by Jobst and Hesse (Lloyd, 1897). When the clinical potential of AChE inhibitors in AD treatment was realized, it was noted that physostigmine was not suitable due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetics, notably its short half-life. Many analogous compounds were synthesized to overcome this and resulted in rivastigmine, which is now marketed by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland) (Grossberg, 2003). Galanthamine, an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid originally isolated from the European snowdrop (Galanthus L. species), is currently marketed as a hydrobromide salt under the name Razadyne®, formerly Reminyl®, for the treatment of AD.

Promising results were obtained with Amaryllidaceae bulbs of Boophone disticha and Crinum moorei. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of Crinum moorei and Boophone disticha also showed AChE inhibiting activity in the TLC assay. These findings together with the long acting, selective, reversible, and competitive AChE inhibitory properties of galanthamine led to the search for other AChE inhibitors from the family Amaryllidaceae. Elgorashi et al. (2004) screened 23 Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, belonging to four ring types, which were isolated from Crinum moorei Hook.f., Crinum macowanii Baker, Crinum bulbispermum (Burm.f.) Milne-Redh. & Schweick. and Cyrtanthus falcatus R.A. Dyer for their AChE inhibitory activity using both the assay on TLC and a 96-well microplate assays also derived from Ellman’s method. ",

The MAO-B inhibitor selegiline was developed for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease based on this hypothesis (Knoll, 2000). MAO-B inhibition also has neuroprotective effects. Since the oxidation step catalyzed by MAO-B yields reactive hydrogen peroxide as a by-product of amine turnover, the generated hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species may cause deterioration in neuronal function or eventually lead to neuronal death. MAO inhibitors reduce oxidant stress by limiting the formation of this reactive species and, hence, may contribute to the control of the aging process (Knoll, 2000). The enzymatic activity of MAO-B increases with age, and is particularly high around senile plaques (Yamada and Yasuhara, 2004). ",
