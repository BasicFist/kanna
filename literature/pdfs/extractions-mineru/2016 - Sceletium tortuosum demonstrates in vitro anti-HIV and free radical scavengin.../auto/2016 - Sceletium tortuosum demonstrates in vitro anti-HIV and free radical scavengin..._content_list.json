In addition, the chemical profile of S. tortuosum was determined using qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analysis. Crude extracts were prepared from dried plant parts of S. tortuosum. Ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from the plants were tested for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 enzymes; protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). S. tortuosum revealed the presence of anthraquinones, terpenes, polyphenols, anthocyanin, tannins, alkaloids, glycosides, carbohydrates and coumarins. The total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents were $1 7 1 . 8 9 \\pm 0 . 0 5 \\mathrm { m g G A E / g }$ , $6 7 8 . 5 1 \\pm 0 . 0 1 \\mathrm { m g } 0 \\mathrm { E } / \\mathrm { g }$ and $9 0 3 . 1 5 \\pm$ $0 . 0 2 \\mathrm { m g } \\mathrm { T A E } / \\mathrm { g }$ extract, respectively. Ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of S. tortuosum inhibited HIV-1 RT and PR respectively. HIV-1 RT inhibition testing had $\\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of $< 5 0$ and $1 2 1 . 7 \\pm 2 . 5 { \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L } }$ for ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts, respectively. In addition, both extracts also inhibited HIV-1 PR with $\\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values $< 1 0 0 up \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ Results of the antiradical activity indicate a dose-dependent ability of the extracts to scavenge DPPH radicals. For this experiment, $\\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ values of $4 9 . 0 \\pm 0 . 2$ and $6 4 . 7 \\pm 3 . 1 \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ were obtained from the ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts, respectively. This suggests that S. tortuosum might be a useful potential source of new lead compounds in the development of new anti-HIV and radical scavenging compounds. ",

Recent studies have highlighted a potential link between oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders (Bakunina et al., 2015; Moylan et al., 2014; Smaga et al., 2015). Oxidative stress is caused by the accumulation of free radicals in the body which can be neutralized or scavenged by either endogenous or exogenous antioxidants. Some plant species belonging to the Aizoaceae family, for example Carpobrotus edulis, are used traditionally in the Eastern Cape, South Africa to boost the immune system of persons with HIV/AIDS as well as treat associated opportunistic infections (Omoruyi et al., 2012a; Vuuren and Naidoo, 2010). Omoruyi et al.

For this reasons oxidative stress is regarded as one of the mechanisms that contributes to the progression of HIV to AIDS (Gil et al., 2003; Kashou and Agarwal, 2011; Mallery et al., 2004). Advanced cases of HIV infection leaves individuals prone to opportunistic infections because of progressive immunodeficiency caused by the virus. Therefore, naturally occurring antioxidants could play a role as inexpensive therapeutic agents that could reduce the HIV viral load of affected individuals. As a result, investigating both the anti-HIV and radical scavenging properties of such plants is recommended. ",

The amounts of total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin from ethanol extract were found to be $1 7 1 . 8 9 \\pm 0 . 0 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g ~ G A E / g }$ , $6 7 8 . 5 1 \\pm 0 . 0 1 \\mathrm { { \\ m g \\ Q E / g } }$ and $9 0 3 . 1 5 \\ \\pm$ $0 . 0 2 \\mathrm { m g } \\mathrm { T A E } / \\mathrm { g }$ extract, respectively. The relative amounts of tannin and flavonoid components were observed to be higher than that of the phenolic components as shown in Table 1. Phytochemical content was only determined for the ethanol extract of S. tortuosum due to the type of extraction undertaken in this study; extraction of dried plant parts in ethanol followed by subsequent extraction of the ethanol filtrate with ethyl acetate to exclude highly polar tannins which are non-specific enzyme inhibitors (Klos et al., 2009). Minimal literature was available on the phytochemical analysis of S. tortuosum, with the exception of alkaloids from S. tortuosum. In the literature, the phytochemical investigation of C. edulis, a plant also belonging to the same family Aizoaceae, demonstrated a high tannin content in the ethanolic extract which is in agreement with data presented in this study (Omoruyi et al., 2012b). However, the relative amount of total phenolic content for C. edulis in the literature was higher than that reported for S. tortuosum in this study. In addition, Omoruyi et al. (2012b) reported lower flavonoid content for C. edulis ethanolic extract. A literature search revealed minimal information on the phytochemical investigation of plants belonging to the Aizoaceae family, thus, encouraging extensive research to be conducted on these plants. The high tannin and flavonoid contents observed here for S. tortuosum can be attributed to the good radical scavenging activity detected. The effect of tannins and flavonoids on the protection of cells from oxidativeinduced damage/death has been reported (Panat et al., 2016; Zielińska-Przyjemska et al., 2015) and the relatively high content of these phytochemicals recorded for S. tortuosum is noteworthy.
