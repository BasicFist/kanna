There is a strong symbiotic relationship between the plant and its endophytes. Endophytes are harboured within the living plant tissues without causing neither diseases nor symptoms. They produce bioactive compounds that protect the host plants against attack of insects, pathogens and herbivores. The bioactive compounds might be utilized for pharmaceutical, agricultural, or biotechnological applications.This paper reported on the various endophytic fungi strains that were isolated from isolated from a medicinal plant, Sceletium tortuosum. Fifty Sceletium tortuosum plants were collected from three different provinces in South Africa and leaves and roots used to isolate culturable endophytes. Morphological characteristics and a genus specific PCR designed to amplify fungal internal transcribe spacer (ITS) region (ITS1 and ITS4) and elongation factor (EF 1 and 2) was used for identification. A total of 60 fungal isolates belonging to 16 genera were identified and classified. Isolates were identified to species level based on similarities with known sequences in GenBank and a large proportion of the fungi were Fusarium species (37%) followed Aspergillus (25%) and Penicillium (7%) species. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences and three potentially new isolates (DR 019 Fusarium penzigii, DR 010 Phomopsis columnaris, DR 007 Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) were identified in the phylogenic tree that was constructed. Our results offers basic data on the symbiotic/or mutualistic relationship between the medicinal plant Sceletium tortuosum and its endophytic fungi, as well as novel species. ",

This dicotyledonous flowering slow-growing plant is endemic to the Cape Region of South Africa and belongs to the family Aizoaceae (Smith et al., 1996). This herbal plant that has been used as a mood-altering drug (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008) has several common names that range from Kanna to Channa, and Kougoed, meaning something to chew or chewable and is known as a psychoactive plant. A traditional concoction called “Kougoed” is prepared from the plant and used to treat cases of intoxication. Although the concoction is not known to be hallucinogenic nor habit forming, it is taken prior to stressing events such as hunting due to its cognitive effects. Numerous studies (Shikanga et al., 2011; Setshedi, 2012) involving the plant have focused on phytochemical analysis and structural elucidation of crude extracts. ",

The presence of these fungi provides several benefits to the plant host such as drought tolerance, protection against pathogens, enhanced growth and prevention from destruction by herbivores (Higginbotham et al., 2013). It has also been reported that endophytic fungi play a very important role in affecting the quality and quantity of the crude extracts produced by host plants through a particular fungus-host interaction and this indicates the need to understand the occurence of these fungi in medicinal plants that are used traditionally for the treatment of infections (Faeth and Fagan, 2002).

It is also known that secondary metabolites produced by plants are obstacles to the colonization of endophytic fungi and therefore these organisms must secrete the matching detoxification enzymes, such as cellulases, lactase, xylanase, and protease, in order to decompose the secondary metabolites such that they can penetrate through the defense systems of the resided host-plants.

To overcome this, endophytic fungi usually assume a latent state once inside the tissues of a host-plant either for the whole lifetime of the host plant (neutralism) or for an extended period of time (mutualism or antagonism) until environmental conditions are favorable for the fungi to its metabolites (Sieber, 2007). Against this background, bioactive compounds that are produced by endophytic fungi, with the exception of those produced by their host plants may enhance the tolerance of both the fungi and the plants to abiotic and biotic stress. Moreover, these compounds produced by endophytic fungi can in turn induce the production of a variety of novel bioactive secondary metabilites that may serve as important medicinal resoureces for humans (Zhang et al., 2006; Firáková et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2009).

        "text": "Further interpretation reveals that all clusters (Cl 1–3) have strains belonging to Division ascomycota while the Division basidiomycota is located in cluster 1 and 2. Nevertheless, the genera Ceratobasidium (GG 6, DR 11) are clustered under different taxa groups 1 and 3. Thoughtprovoking strains are situated in cluster 1 but in different sub-clusters (DR 12, GG2) belonging to the division Oomycota and Zygomycota. Ascomycota dominates the scientific classification with an average of 81% in the phylogenetic tree. Strong phylogenetic relationships/ homology (95–100%) was shown with symbols. On the other hand 50% and less were not displayed in the phylogenetic tree. This data correspond with Miguel et al., (2017), Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were the dominate phyla isolated from eucalyptus leaves. Based on the allocation of stains in the phylogenetic tree, there are three potential novel endophytic fungi (DR 7, DR 10, DR 19) situated in all the clusters. Furthermore, the strains were isolated from the same location. All strains were belonging to the genus Fusarium with different species and subspecies. ",

        "text": "To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi isolates from indigenous S. tortuosum. The current study demonstrates the relatively high variety of fungal communities from the biodiversity of three locations in South Africa. The extensive richness of endophytes in the roots and leaves is directly proportional to physiological and/or ecological importance of medicinal plants. In the current study, the CR value is higher in leaves, hence more endophyic fungi habour the leaves than the roots. Three novel isolates were identified in the phylogenetic tree. Our findings lay a critical foundation in a deeper understanding of S. tortuosum. This baseline data provides valid directions for future research particularly analysis of the bioactive compounds produced by these fungi and their therapeutic applications as well as extracellular enzymes that they produce.
