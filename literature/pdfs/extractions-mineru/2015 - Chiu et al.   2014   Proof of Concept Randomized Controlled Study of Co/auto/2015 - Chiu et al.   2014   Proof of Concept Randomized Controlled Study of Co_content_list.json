The disease burden of AD can be present before any symptoms appear. This finding opens up new avenues of proactive interventions at the asymptomatic stage with the objective to “postpone the onset, reduce the risks of, or completely prevent the clinical stages of AD\"[6].In this respect dietary interventions through hitting multiple targets for AD:amyloid-Aβ1-42 aggregation, neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and tau (microtubule-associated protein) phosphorylation, can offer unique advantages to attenuate the self-propagating course of AD and to prevent the transition from MCI to early AD [7].

The dual second messengers induce signal cascades involved in neuronal survival, apoptosis,and synaptic plasticity and neural connectivity. The cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB）appears to orchestrate the signal transduction from gene activation to effector responses of cognition. The aging process is linked to differential changes in gene expression of PDE subtypes [9]. In the rodent species, PDE-4 gene knockout resulted in memory improvement in the rodent species [10].

Caffeine (1,3,5-trimethylxanthine),widely consumed as coffee in the world,targets both PDE subtypes 4and 5 (PDE-4,PDE-5) and adenosine-2 receptor [15]. Epidemiological studies indicate that coffee/caffeine consumption is likely to be associated with a reduced risk of AD [16,17]. In the prospective Cardiovascular Risk Factors,Aging,and Dementia (CAIDE) study, daily coffee drinking totaling 3-5 cups per day at midlife reduced AD risk by about $6 5 \\%$ at late life[18]. ",

We had privileged access to the CNS Vital Signs through an academic-research contract with CNS Vital Signs Inc.,USA [24]. The test battery was administered under standardized conditions by qualified personnel. The battery of neuropsychological tests was developed to measure the changes in 9 cognitive domains: composite memory, verbal memory, visual memory， processing speed, executive function, psychomotor speed,reaction, complex attention,and cognitive flexibility. The subjects were also administered HAM-D and treatment emergent adverse events at face-to-face interview with research clinicians experienced in clinical trials.Subjects were randomized by the procedure of computerized random numbers to either one of the two arms: (l） the active investigational product arm received extract Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin) $2 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ capsule (abbreviated Zembrin group); (2) the placebo arm received placebo capsule (abbreviated placebo group).During the first 3-week phase of the study blinded to both the researchers and the subjects, the participants randomized to the Zembrin group took a $2 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ capsule of Zembrin once daily orally whereas the placebo group took a placebo capsule once a day orally. At the end of the first 3-week phase, the subjects were allowed a 3-week washout, during which time no capsules were ingested by either group. During the second 3-week switch-over phase, the Zembrin group took a placebo capsule once a day orally and the placebo group took the $2 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ Zembrin capsule once daily orally. During the entire 9-week study period, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) and body weight were monitored. CNS Vital SignR, HAM-D,and treatment emergent adverse events were administered at baseline and the end of weeks 3,6,and 9. The study was fully approved by Aspire Inc. (CA,USA),a community institutional research ethics board granting approval and monitoring clinical trials.Research subjects participated in the study only after they were fully explained the protocol and signed the informed consent form.

The family of mesembrine alkaloids from Zembrin exhibit serotonergic properties in competing for serotonin transporter site in vitro [23,24]. Serotonin is known to play a central role in decision processing and attentional set shifting [36]. Very recently, citalopram,the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been shown to reduce the CSF amyloid $\\mathrm { A } \\beta$ load in both normal human subjects and in transgenic mice [37]. Hence, serotonin signaling may synergize with PDE-coupled camp cascade in modulating age-related cognition changes [38]. ",

In sleep deprivation model, the C57BL/6J mice when sleep deprived for 5 hours showed selective impairment in cAMP/phosphokinase A-dependent synaptic plasticity which is reflected in the long-term potentiation (LTP) paradigm,in the hippocampus. [40]. Genetic knock-down of PDE-4D enzyme: PDE4d $\\left( - / - \\right)$ mice displayed an antidepressant phenotype in two behavioral models: the Porsolt forced swim test and the acoustic startle response [4l].No adverse changes were noted in the sensorimotor gating deficits.Taken together, the potential anxiolytic/antidepressant and sleep-promoting properties of Zembrin warrant further investigations in the elderly.
