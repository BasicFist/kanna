As an p.o formulation，this drug offers the advantage of improved compliance; however, its perceived lack of efficacy, the necessity to monitor plasma levels， coupled with numerous side effects,known drug interactions,and the effect of smoking on plasma clearance (Boswell-Smith et al., 2006a）have provided an impetus to discover a better theophylline.Moreover, whereas glucocorticosteroids are of clinical utility in asthma (Barnes, 2Oo6a),they are of limited use in COPD (Rennard,2OO4).There is clearly an unmet clinical need for the development of disease-modifying drugs in COPD because other than cigarette smoke cessation, current drug therapy does not prevent the accelerated decline in lung function.

It was originally shown that theophylline inhibited the activity of a cyclic $3 ^ { \\prime }$ $5 ^ { \\prime }$ nucleotide PDE with a Ki of $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ (Butcher and Sutherland, 1962).This might account for its beneficial effects clinically,as an increase in the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP can reduce the activation of a wide range of inflammatory and lung resident cells.There are presently 11 known families of PDE and at least 21 isoforms with numerous splice variants that are characterized by differences in structure,substrate specificity,inhibitor selectivity, tissue and cell distribution，regulation by kinases,protein-protein interaction and subcellular distribution (Houslay et al.，2OO5； Bender and Beavo，2006). However，targeting PDE4， the enzyme responsible for metabolizing cyclic AMP has been the focus for the development of drugs that could prove beneficial in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as asthma (Torphy, 1998;Houslay et al.,2Oo5).It is therefore of interest that plasma levels achieved with a dose of theophylline that demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity (Sullivan et al.,1994) was well below the Ki for PDE inhibition and suggested that PDE4 inhibition alone does not completely explain this drugs clinical effectiveness (Barnes et al.,2005).

There are four gene families (A-D),although there is added complexity with over 2O splice variants (Houslay et al, 2007).Hydrolysis of cyclic AMP is a common feature of this family,and itis clear that these isoforms can be targeted to different domains within the extracellular compartment and their activity differentially regulated by kinases,suggesting that these isoforms have specific functions in the control of cellular activity (Houslay et al., 2oo7). X-ray crystallography has resolved the catalytic domain of these enzymes,which are comprised of three important domains,consisting of a bivalent metal-binding pocket $( \\mathrm { Z n } ^ { 2 + } , \\mathrm { M g } ^ { 2 + } )$ ,which forms a complex with the phosphate moiety of cyclic AMP,a pocket containing glutamine (Q pocket)，which forms hydrogen bonds with the nucleotide (purine) moiety of cyclic AMP, and a solvent pocket.PDE4 inhibitors occupy this active site through a number of important interactions and prevent cyclic AMP metabolism.These include indirect binding to the metal ions by the formation of hydrogen bonding to water,whereas hydrophobic interactions between the planar ring structure of these inhibitors and hydrophobic aminoacid residues such as phenylalanine and isoleucine serve to ‘clamp'the inhibitor within the active site and hydrogen bond interaction between the aromatic ring structure of these inhibitors and the invariant glutamine residue in the Q pocket, the site which is normally occupied by the nucleotide moiety of cyclic AMP (Xu et al., 200O; Card et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007).

It might reasonably be argued that targeting PDE4 could potentially suppress the function of numerous cell types; however,it is well known that other PDE enzymes are also expressed in these cells and the contribution of other PDEs to cell function (for example,PDE3,PDE7）in the context of benefits in respiratory diseases is being explored (Smith et al.,2004;Boswell-Smith et al.，2006b).It would seem prudent to develop subtype selective PDE4 inhibitors in attempts to maximize therapeutic benefit at the expense of adverse effects,whereas there is also the possibility that nonselective PDE inhibitors might offer a better approach in targeting multiple target cells in the disease process.Indeed, it has been suggested that clozapine isa better anti-psychotic than newer generation atypical anti-psychotics because this drug targets numerous receptors,and as such，has been described as a‘magic shotgun'，for the treatment of Schizophrenia (Roth et al.,2004).

Similarly, increased total PDE catalytic activity was observed in peripheral blood monocytes from individuals with mild asthma,whereas this was associated,paradoxically，with reduced PDE4 activity (Landells et al.,2O0O) and the expression of PDE4A-D was not increased in peripheral blood cluster of differentiation (CD)4 positive T lymphocytes in patients with mild asthma (Jones et al.，2OO7).Together these studies indicate that the underlying pathogenesis of mild asthma cannot be attributed to enhanced PDE4 expression or activity.

One disadvantage of these studies is the inability to ascertain the role of PDE4 isoforms because of the nonselective nature of the PDE4 inhibitors currently under development. The use of genetically modified mice has revealed some interesting findings. Airway inflammation characterized by recruitment of eosinophils to the airways of mice deficient in PDE4D was no different to wild-type controls (Hansen et al.,2OoO).This indicated that other PDE4 subtypes contributed in the metabolism of intracellular cyclic AMP,as cell recruitment to the airways was inhibited when animals were treated with nonselective PDE4 inhibitors (Kung et al.，200O;Kanehiro et al., 2001). However,airway obstruction caused by methacholine was enhanced in wild-type allergic mice but was abolished in PDE4D gene-deficient mice. These mice were hyporesponsive to this stimulus，even in the absence of allergic sensitization and appeared to be related to an increase in dilator prostaglandin production in the airways of these gene-deficient mice (Hansen et al.,20oo; Mehats et al.,2003). However,this effect was specific for methacholine because the enhanced airway obstruction in response to serotonin was unaffected by the removal of PDE4D (Hansen et al., 2000). This study highlighted the potential complimentary role of PDE4 isoforms in regulating allergic airway inflammation,and the need to target more than one PDE4 isoform because inhibition of the inflammatory response,hyperresponsiveness and airway remodelling in allergic wild-type mice was observed following exposure to PDE4 inhibitors suchas rolipram and roflumilast (Kung et al.,2ooo;Kanehiro et al.,2001; Kumar et al.,2003).

A similar degree of inhibition of the late phase response was observed following once daily treatment for 7-10 days with roflumilast (van Schalkwyk et al., 20o5). This late phase response is used by clinicians to model the inflammatory component following an allergic insult to the airways.In both studies,the effects of drug treatment on the acute allergen bronchoconstriction was modest and is consistent with the lack of demonstrable action of PDE4 inhibition on mast cell function (Table 1) and highlight the role of other PDE enzymes,namely PDE3 in the context of airway smooth muscle relaxation (Boswell-Smith et al., 2006b). Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not reduced by these drugs，although a later study purported to show modest protection against allergen-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness(Louw et al.,20o7), which might suggest that PDE4 may not be a suitable target for this particular phenomenon,or that higher doses are required to provide complementary and persistent inhibition of the enzyme and hence attenuation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.It is of interest that roflumilast has a plasma half-life of $^ { 1 6 \\mathrm { h } }$ following a single p.o administration,and is metabolized by CYP3A4 to the active N-oxide metabolite，which has considerably greater bioavailability with a half-life of $^ { 2 0 \\mathrm { h } }$ that would favour prolonged enzyme exposure (David et al., 2004).This favourable pharmacokinetic profile would be anticipated to produce long periods of PDE4 inhibition. There was a significant reduction in the activity of circulating monocytes in patients maintained on roflumilast for 4 weeks，whereas the magnitude of this change was small, resulting in approximately 1.3-fold reduction in tumour necrosis factor- $\\mathbb { X }$ production by monocytes in response to endotoxin challenge in vitro (Timmer et al., 2002). Therefore, it is questionable whether total PDE4 inhibition can be achieved in cells within the airway tissue compartment at the dose used in clinical studies. ",

The mechanism of the improvement in spirometry is unlikely to be due to relaxation of airway smooth muscle because this drug class has weak bronchodilator activity. It is possible that this improvement is due to an anti-inflammatory action of the drugs (Table 1), although no biomarker of inflammation was measured in these studies.However，separate studies have addressed whether PDE4 inhibitors are anti-inflammatory in COPD. Both roflumilast (Grootendorst et al.，2oo7） and cilomilast (Gamble et al.,20o3) reduced the number of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and lymphocytes recruited to the airways and the levels of two biochemical markers of this disease,namely interleukin-8 and neutrophil elastase.The magnitude of the change in the number of these inflammatory cells and concentration of mediators was between 30 and $5 0 \\%$ and might underlie their beneficial action in the phase II clinical trials.However,the biomarker study also highlights arecurring theme that complementary inhibition of PDE4 was not achievable because of dose-limiting side effects;or alternatively，other PDE isoforms (for example, PDE3,7,see Table 1) in these same inflammatory processes may also require targeting for a full anti-inflammatory action to be revealed in this disease.

However,a surrogate biological response that measures the reversal of anaesthesia induced by $\\propto 2$ -adrenoceptor agonists has been used to study the role of PDE4 subtypes in emesis (Robichaud et al.,20o1,2002a). It was previously shown that the ability of PDE4 inhibitors to induce emesis in the ferret was inhibited by the $\\propto 2$ -selective agonist,clonidine (Robichaud et al.，20o1） and suggested that raising cyclic AMP within central noradrenergic terminals by PDE4 inhibitors promoted emesis,and this could be attenuated by $\\propto 2$ -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of AC.The hypnotic action of xylazine was reversed in rodents treated with PDE4 inhibitors(Robichaud et al.,2oo1)and therefore used as a surrogate for emesis.Deletion of PDE4D and not PDE4B reduced the duration of anaesthesia induced by xylazine, compared with wild-type mice,and second,the ability of PDE4 inhibitors to shorten xylazine-induced anaesthesia was impaired in PDE4D but not PDE4B knockout mice (Robichaud et al.,2Oo2b).Together, these studies suggested that PDE4 inhibitors with low affinity for PDE4D should have reduced emetic potential.

Similarly, the emetic profile ofvarious PDE4 inhibitors in the ferret cannot be explained by their selectivity for PDE4D or to differences in PDE4D inhibitor potency (Figure 1). One possible explanation might be that some PDE4 inhibitors preferentially partition within the CNS and hence the degree of PDE4D inhibition in area postrema neurones might explain the differences in the emetic potential of these drugs (Aoki et al.,2oo1;Robichaud et al.,2oo2a).However, the concentration of the'low emetic' PDE4 inhibitor, CT-2450 within the CNS was comparable to that achieved by the most potent emetic PDE4 inhibitor, PMNPQ (Figure 1).Second，the area postrema is not completely behind the blood-brain barrier (Gross et al., 1990)，and therefore accessible to free drug within the circulation.It would seem unlikely that differential partitioning of these inhibitors within the CNS is a likely explanation for their ability to induce emesis.However,it remains to be established whether the magnitude of PDE4 inhibition within the area postrema differs between the various PDE4 inhibitors.

However, none of these events appear to be realized in phase I and phase I clinical trials undertaken with cilomilast and roflumilast. Similarly,slow release theophylline has been used for decades in the treatment of asthma and COPD and has not been associated with a number of these potentially adverse events (Ohta et al.,2Oo4).
