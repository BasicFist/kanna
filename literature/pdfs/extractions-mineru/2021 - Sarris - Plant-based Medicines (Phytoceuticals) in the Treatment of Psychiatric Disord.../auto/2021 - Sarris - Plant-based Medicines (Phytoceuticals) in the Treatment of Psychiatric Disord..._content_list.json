An example can be found in our sister-review on nutraceuticals,11 which included 33 meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs involving 10,951 individuals, covering a range of nutrients including ω-3 fatty acids, methylfolate, and n-acetyl cysteine.

The formulas studied included Chaihu-Shugan-San, Xiao Yao San, Ganmai Dazao, Wuling, Shuganjieyu, Wendan Decoction, Jiu Wei Zhen Xin (see supplementary Table 1). These were administered via decoction, granule, or capsule delivery. As mentioned in the Methods section, only the broad results were highlighted due to concerns over the reporting and methodological strengths of the studies included in the meta-analyses. All publications reported highly significant results in favor of the Chinese herbal medicine, and in some cases TCHMs were superior to standard antidepressants such as fluoxetine. Adverse events from these interventions were reported as very low, and in many adjunctive studies the Chinese herbal formulas were reported incidentally to ameliorate some of the medication side effects.

Kava was not effective in treating diagnosed anxiety disorders, with an absence of statistical significance in GAD, while some supportive data for saffron for this application were evident. These results in the main reflects the position held in the most recent Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment guidelines.44 The data concerning kava should also be further taken into context due to a recently published large RCT involving the phytoceutical in the treatment of GAD, which revealed a nonsignificant effect compared to placebo45 on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. However, it can be noted that research has generally supported kava in nonclinical populations (potentially for more “situational” anxiety as a short-term anxiolytic). All 22 meta-analyses of Chinese herbal medicine formulas (primarily for depression studies) revealed highly significant and large effect sizes, but their methodologies, reporting, and potential publication bias were of marked concern. Additionally, an important caveat is that many studies included in the curcumin, ginkgo, and saffron meta-analyses may have had publication bias (in respect to negative studies potentially not being published). Additional more rigorous international studies are therefore required to validate these results. ",

First, studies were confined to the English language, and some research may have been excluded. Further, some of the data from studies contained within the individual meta-analyses had poor reporting and weak methodological standards, small samples, or absence of constituent standardization, thus some degree of caution needs to be applied, most notably in respect to TCHM formulas46 and saffron. A final consideration is that regarding the data including within the meta-analyses, these commonly derived data from individual RCTs using “completer” analyses, and not more statistically acceptable intention-to-treat data. Due to this, there is presently limited clinical utility of the results in the metareview in making treatment determinations. More research is required to firmly validate TCHM formulas and saffron across more diverse jurisdictions, in addition to more research on more newly studied phytoceuticals such as curcumin. ",
