        "text": "Sceletium tortuosum is a South African protected species with tremendous value in traditional and modern medicine. The plants’ mesembrine-type alkaloids are potential therapeutics for a plethora of psychological, neurological and infammatory disorders. In our in vitro and ex vivo studies, vegetative propagation and growth of this species were investigated. Cytokinin (CK) profles were also explored. Shoot multiplication was induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with $2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). In vitro-generated shoots were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with 0, 2.5, 5.0 and $1 0 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ IBA or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Optimal rooting $( 5 5 \\% )$ , mean number of roots $( 3 . 8 0 \\pm 0 . 8 3 ) $ and new leaf pairs $( 4 . 6 5 \\pm 0 . 6 7 )$ were achieved by $1 0 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ IBA. After greenhouse acclimatization, $4 5 { - } 9 0 \\%$ of plantlets survived. All ex vivo shoot cuttings rooted well $( 9 0 - 1 0 0 \\%$ ). The highest mean number of roots $( 1 1 . 2 0 \\pm 1 . 3 7 ) $ and root length $( 5 7 . 1 8 \\pm 3 . 8 5 \\mathrm { m m } )$ were obtained by $5 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ IBA. Although spontaneous rooting was observed in both experiments, auxins enhanced multiple growth parameters. Cytokinin analyses of tissue-cultured (auxin-treated) and greenhouse (untreated) plants revealed higher cytokinin levels in vitro. These investigations provide rapid and efcient propagation techniques for Sceletium tortuosum which will be valuable to conservationists and pharmaceutical companies. ",

However, it is most-exploited for its mood-enhancing and calming properties (Digby 2005; Laidler 1928; Rood 1994; Thunberg 1795).

Non-aseptic techniques such as grafting, budding, layering and cuttings are common and involve the use of plant organs only (LeBude and Blazich 2018). However, through aseptic plant tissue culture, somatic cells, tissues and organs can be utilized (George et al. 2008; Skoog and Miller 1957).

Both are involved in the induction and development of root and shoot meristems, branching of lateral and aerial organs and the formation of reproductive organs (Aloni et al. 2006a, b; Chandler 2011; D’Aloia et al. 2011; Schaller et al. 2015; Shimizu-Sato et al. 2009; Su et al. 2011).

Plant material was ground in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried. Sample preparation and CK analysis were carried out via the procedure developed by Novák et al. (2008). Briefy, technical triplicates $2 \\mathrm { m g }$ per sample) were homogenized and extracted with $1 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ of modifed Bieleski bufer ( $6 0 \\%$ methanol, $1 0 \\%$ formic acid, $3 0 \\%$ water (Hoyerová et al. 2006)) with a cocktail of stable isotopelabelled internal standards (0.25 pmol of CK bases, ribosides and $N .$ -glucosides, and 0.5 pmol of CK $o$ -glucosides and nucleotides per sample) (Gupta et al. 2019). Extracts were purifed with a combination of C18 ( $\\mathrm { 1 \\ m L / 3 0 \\ m g }$ ) and MCX ( $\\mathrm { 1 \\ m L / 3 0 \\ m g }$ ) cartridges (Dobrev and Kamínek 2002). Eluates were evaporated until dry and dissolved in $3 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ of $1 0 \\%$ methanol. Cytokinin levels were determined using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) device (Acquity UPLC $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ I-class System; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray interface (Xevo™ TQ-S, Waters, Manchester, UK). Multiple reaction monitoring of $[ \\mathbf { M } + \\mathbf { H } ] ^ { + }$ and the appropriate product ion allowed for quantifcation. MassLynx software was used to compare the ratio of CKs and internal standards of known concentration to determine individual CK levels (Novák et al. 2008; Plačková et al. 2017; Svačinová et al. 2012). Detected CKs are reported in $\\mathrm { p m o l / g }$ DW (dry weight). ",

Zhang et al. (1995) documented an increase in adenine derivatives due to enhanced CK oxidase activity caused by auxin. Cytokinin oxidase results in the irreversible inactivation of CKs. However, N-glucosylation can prevent the action of CK oxidase altogether (Kieber and Schaller 2014; Werner et al. 2006). Hence, N-glucosylation may have been triggered to convert CKs to conjugates that can release free CK bases (Hoyerová and Hošek 2020).

Through this pathway, a previously absent CK conjugate (mT9G) was produced in abundance. Despite high levels of this and other inactive CK conjugates, the active free base CK pools of both samples were similar in size (Table 1). This suggests that increased conjugation was induced to regulate the active CK level in response to the large CK quantities being produced (Hoyerová and Hošek 2020). N-glucosylation is a method of inactivating active CKs to achieve said regulation. Furthermore, 7-glucosylation is usually the pathway utilized for quickly modulating active CK levels (Fox et al. 1973; Šmehilová et al. 2016). This mechanism accounts for the heightened levels of ",

During the growth period, plantlets may have acclimated to the uptake of this low concentration of IBA. This could have allowed the explants to tolerate and make full use of an even higher concentration during the experiment $( 1 0 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M } )$ . Following this logic, plantlets had never before experienced an exogenous supply of IAA and may have begun acclimating to this during the experiment. During this process, signalling for the storage of some IAA, as well as for root proliferation would have been ongoing (Korasick et al. 2013; Ljung et al. 2005; Normanly et al. 2010; Overvoorde et al. 2010).
