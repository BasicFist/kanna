Methods: This study is covering articles between 1969 and 2018, reviewed from internationally accepted databases and scientific data from scientific Journals. Results: Phytochemically studied plants of family Aizoaceae have shown the presence of various classes of compounds including; alkaloids, triterpenes, sterols, lignans, phenolic compounds, betacyanins, and essential oils. Biological studies on plants of family Aizoaceae have indicated various bioactive potentials including antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antitumor, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and other effects. The reported medicinal plants of family Aizoaceae were selected and summarized on the basis of their; phytochemical constituents and biological activities. Conclusion: The results of this study may inspire further ethno-botanical and ethno-pharmacological research and investigations toward drug discovery. ",

With approximately 1860 species in 127 genera, and in India the family is represented by three genera, namely, Sesuvium, Trianthema and Zaleya with seven species distributed in the coastal and lowland areas of peninsular India and the Gangetic plains2. It is also South Africa's second largest plant family3. Based on the division given by Bittrich & Hartmann4, five subfamilies are recognized: Aizooideae, Mesembryanthmoideae, Rushioideae, Sesuvioideae and Tetragonioideae5. In Egypt, Boulos6 recognized five genera, but Hosny7 listed only four genera without considering Sesuvium. According to Boulos6 and Hosny7, Trianthema is represented in Egypt by two species: T. portulacastrum L. and either T. triquetra Willd. Ex Spreng. (according to Boulos6) or T. Crystalline (Forssk.) Vahl (according to Hosny7). Zaleya is represented by two species: Z. pentandra (L.) C. Jeffrey and Z. decandra (L.) Burm. f.6, or by only one species: Z. pentandra (L.) C. Jeffrey7. This family is represented in Egypt by 6 genera and 10 species8. It typically inhabits dry subtropical deserts and wet tropical coasts5-9. Native species of Aizoaceae are distributed through Mediterranean coastal habitats and the Nile Valley as weeds of cultivated land, and extend to deserts. ",

Extracts from these plants are used as preservatives, as a remedy against throat infections and in soap making13. Although Aizoaceae is considered as one of the most diverse and abundant families, it was found that it is the least studied in terms of medicinal potential14. It would, therefore, be important to extensively investigate other plants of family Aizoaceae for future drug discovery.

Only two genera of family Aizoaceae were reported to be rich with alkaloids which are genus Sceletium and genus Trianthema as shown in Table 1.

The mesembrine alkaloid is the most studied of the mesembrine alkaloids due to its relative abundance in S. tortuosum and biological activity, it was initially partially isolated, characterized, and named by Zwicky, and it was purified and crystallized as picrate19. Mesembranol and its acetylated derivative, 4-Oacetylmesembrenol was also isolated together with 4-Odemethylmesembrenol and 4-O-demethylmesembranol from Sceletium spp in addition to mesembrenone. Joubertiamine and its derivatives represented a new structural class different from the known mesembranes. Joubertiamine, dehydrojoubertiamine, and dihydrojoubertiamine were all referred to as the secomesembranes and were isolated from Sceletium joubertii17. The preponderance of research on Sceletium alkaloids has revolved around isolation and structural elucidation. Very little is known about the distribution and chemotaxonomic patterns of these alkaloids within the genus17. ",

The chloroform extract of T. decandra also exhibited significant antiinflammatory properties in dextran-induced paw edema model. Dextran-induced paw edema is known to be mediated both by histamine and serotonin.
