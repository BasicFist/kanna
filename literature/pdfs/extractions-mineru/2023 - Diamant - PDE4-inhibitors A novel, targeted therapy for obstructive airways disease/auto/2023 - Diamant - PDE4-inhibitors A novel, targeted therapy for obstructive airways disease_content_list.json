In several phase Iltrials in patients with moderate to (very) severe COPD and in patients with symptoms of chronic bronchitis and recurrent exacerbations, roflumilast showed sustained clinical efficacy by improving lung function and by reducing exacerbation rates. These beneficial effects have also been demonstrated when added to long-acting bronchodilators (both LABA and LAMA), underscoring the anti-inflammatory activity of roflumilast in COPD. Pooled data analysis showed overall mild to moderate, mostly self-limiting adverse events, mainly consisting of nausea, diarrhea and weight loss.In this review we discuss the results of the 4 registration studies showing promising efects of roflumilast in COPD and provide an overview of the topics that still need to be addressed.

These features present as fixed airway obstruction, hyperinflation, dyspnea, mucus hypersecretion and chronic cough. In addition, there is an impairment of the overall health status [2]. The morbidity and mortality due to COPD is increasing worldwide [2].

These insults induce chronic inflammation and remodeling, including structural changes and destruction of alveolar tissue, within the lung [2-5]. ",

The destruction of alveolar tissue (emphysema) is thought to be caused by the release of proteinase (such as matrix metaloproteinase from alveolar macrophages) or as a consequence of an autoimmune response (e.g. $\\mathtt { C D 8 + }$ T lymphocytes)[6]. Chronic airway inflammation may induce several aspects of airway remodeling, exemplified by goblet cell hyperplasia and enlargement of submucosal glands, which contribute to the excessve mucus production in subjects with chronic bronchitis. Peribronchiolar fibrosis in distal airways is another feature of remodeling， which can induce disruption of the parenchymal attachments to small airways promoting collapse on expiration and hyperinflation [3]. More recently, evidence was provided that the abnormalities seen in COPD are not only restricted to the airways, but also systemically present [7]. ",

Alternatively， pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of COPD are stil limited. Whilst the currently advocated treatment with long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) and/or long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) with or without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been shown to produce temporary improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance and quality of life, the evidence for reducing exacerbations [8] and,consequently,the rate of decline in lung function,is less convincing [2,9]. Nor do these drugs improve the systemic features of COPD [10]. In contrast,several studies showed that LABAs may increase morbidity and mortality due to cardiac comorbidity in susceptible patients [11,12]. Consequently, despite maximal treatment, too many COPD patients stil remain symptomatic and experience exacerbations [2],indicating that the current treatment options lack sustained efficacy or disease-modifying properties. Hence, there is a large need of therapeutic modalities producing sustained clinical efficacy for a more optimal treatment of COPD. ",

However, the application of the prototypic non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-inhibitors,aminophylline and theophylline, has been limited by many drug-interactions and a narrow dose-range， causing many dose-dependent， mostly cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects. Whilst theophylline may non-selectively target PDE, albeit at high concentrations, recent evidence points to inhibition of phosphoinositide 3 kinase as a target for the anti-inflammatory action of this drug[14].In the past decade,interest in PDE-inhibitors has revived due to the identification of 11 different isoenzymes (PDE1-11) within the PDEsuperfamily. Each isoenzyme has different tissue subdivision and different properties, hence enabling targeted therapy with potentially fewer (systemic) side effects. In particular, in contrast to nonselective PDE-inhibition,there is considerable interest in selectively targeting the PDE4-isoenzyme, which is expressed in inflammatory cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages) and structural cells (e.g. fibroblasts, epithelium,sensory nerves, smooth muscle cels) within the lung [15] (Table 1). The presence of the PDE4-isoenzyme in many of the celltypes implicated in COPD would make it a promising target for disease modifying therapy,given the strong relationship between chronic airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion with increased decline in lung function [16]. Most of the (long-term) studies in COPD so far have been performed with the second generation of oral PDE4- inhibitors, cilomilast (Glaxo Smith Kline) and roflumilast (Nycomed),of which roflumilast possesses the best pharmacological profile (once daily dosing) combined with good clinical eficacy with overall mild and self limiting side effects [17]. In this review we will focus on the most recent clinical trials with the PDE4-inhibitor, roflumilast, showing clinical effcacy in patients with COPD. ",

The improvement in baseline lung function developed gradually,suggesting that, unlike current bronchodilators used in COPD,PDE4-inhibitors may modulate lung function by mechanisms unrelated to airway smooth muscle relaxation per se. Indeed,in contrast to salbutamol or ipratropium bromide,administration of cilomilast failed to produce an immediate bronchodilator response [23]. This is also consistent with numerous in vitro studies using isolated human bronchial tissues.In these studies, various PDE4-inhibitors appeared to be poor functional antagonists and produced modest relaxation of airway smooth muscle [24-28]. Another longer-term study with cilomilast confirmed the previously observed improvements in lung function and additionally showed a significant reduction in COPD exacerbations and improvements in quality of life scores [29].The mechanism for these improvements can likely be attributed to an antiinflammatory activity. In this respect, cilomilast has been shown to reduce the number of several pro-inflammatory cels, implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD， including CD8+T lymphocytes, ${ \\mathsf { C D 8 6 + } }$ monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils in lung biopsies from subjects with COPD by approximately $40 \\%$ [30]. This incomplete inhibition might account why the improvements in lung function were not maintained over the 12 week course of this study. Other possble explanations for the improvements in lung function,exacerbation rates and quality of life additional to the indirect bronchodilator effect of cilomilast seen in a majority of these clinical trials could be partly attributed to a modulation of sensory nerve function [31, 32]. A consequence of reduced sensory input to the central nervous system would be a decrease in parasympathetic outflow to the airways, a reduction in contraction of airway smooth muscle and submucosal gland secretion， both leading to improvements in airflow and symptoms. Alternatively， the activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) via elevating the level of cyclic AMP in airway epithelial cells could promote rehydration of the epithelial periciliary layer thereby facilitating mucociliary clearance of mucus and bacteria [33]. Indeed, PDE4 inhibitors can reduce mucus production and increase ciliary beat frequency of airway epithelial cels [34,35]. ",

The inclusion criteria were based on a post-hoc analysis of a previous study, suggesting a decrease in exacerbations by roflumilast in this COPD-phenotype [40]. Initially, $44 \\%$ of the patients were using ICS or LAMA or both: these drugs have been discontinued for the duration of the study (1 year). Concomitant use of short-acting beta2-agonists, short-acting muscarinic antagonists and LABA was allowed and at randomization; patients were stratified according to initial LABA use to allw a prespecified subgroup analysis.In both studies,after a 4 week placebo-run in period, patients received either roflumilast or placebo for 52 weeks on top of their existing anti-COPD medication.

The reduction in exacerbations in COPD-patients treated with tiotropium bromide was not accompanied by a reduction in inflammatory cels or sputum cytokine or chemokine levels [46,47]. Following treatment with this LAMA,sputum levels of pro-inflammatory mediators tended to rise, which could be a consequence of a reduction in mucus secretion, thereby concentrating the levels of these mediators. However, these changes are unlikely to be clinicaly relevant in view of their small magnitude (less than 2 fold) and improvements in lung function and reduction in exacerbations seen in large trials (Table 1).

Interestingly，the effect of fluticasone monotherapy on airway neutrophil numbers is conflicting， with both reports of a reduction [48] and increase [52] and again, the differences could be due to the relatively short duration of treatment in a limited number of patients in these studies. Alternatively，there is evidence of a (relative) corticosteroid resistance in patients with COPD. Although recent studies yielded a number of possible mechanisms to explain this insensitivity,the central hypothesis implies the increase in oxidant burden within the lungs,resulting in reduction in the activity of histone deacetylase(HDAC)-2. Accordingly， increasing theHDAC2-activitybyPDE-inhibitors, phosphoinositide 3 kinase-delta inhibitors and macrolides could result in a reversal of corticosteroid resistance [53]. ",

Similarly， PDE4-inhibition promoted chemokine expression in monocyte/macrophage in culture [65] Suggesting that this drug class might be anticipated to potentialy promote inflammation. However, these data are not consistent with numerous studies documenting anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4-inhibitors (Table 1). Indeed，roflumilast treatment alone failed to significantly increase macrophage and neutrophil cell number in the lung in a preclinical model of smoke-induced inflammation, but reduced the rise in macrophage and neutrophil cel numbers caused by cigarette smoke exposure [18,66].Similarly, human clinical data shows that the PDE4-inhibitors,cilomilast and roflumilast， reduce inflammatory cell numbers in the lung compartment [43, 67]. In conclusion, ample evidence has been provided that the PDE4-inhibitors cilomilast and roflumilast,at a clinically relevant dose, are capable of reducing airway inflammation. ",

In patients with symptomatic (very) severe COPD with chronic cough,sputum and prone to frequent exacerbations,roflumilast caused relief through improvements in lung function and, more importantly, through decrease in exacerbation rates, in addition to their existing anti-COPD therapy. Since the improvements in lung function by roflumilast have been additive to concomitant use of LABA or LAMA,this suggests anti-inflammatory activity. A pooled data analysis showed that the side effects associated with roflumilast (nausea, headache, diarrhea and weight loss) were mostly mild to moderate and usually self-limiting, although resulted in an increased patient withdrawal across the studies.
