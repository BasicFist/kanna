The main alkaloids responsible for these properties are mesembrine, mesembrenine (mesembrenone), and mesembrenol. The potential of the plant to be an alternative supplement in the promotion of health and treating a variety of psychological and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety has stimulated interest in its pharmacological property and possibility of its commercialization. The economic value of indigenous medicinal plants in South Africa is approximately US\\$60 000 000 or R4 000 000 000 annually. Thus, interest in the knowledge and use of Traditional African Medicinal Plants (TAMP) as well as meeting pharmacological and economic needs of ever-increasing human population has led to the commercialization of traditional African medicines at a fast rate. It was found that S. tortuosum has clear pharmaceutical and economical importance and is one of the only known plants to contain the alkaloids mesembrenone and mesembrine which can be utilized for the promotion of health and/or treating a variety of psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression.

Common terms used to describe this group of succulent plants are vygies, fig-marigolds, flowering-stones, ice plants and, midday flowers, among others. These plants fascinate many plant enthusiasts and have become popular collector’s items due to their remarkable variation in leaf architecture, flower color and form, and fruit structure (Figure 2). Different genera within the family grow in various habitats, and examples can thus be found growing in rocky crevices, silty flats and in saline wastelands.

High EC indicates a high concentration of nutrients within the solution, while a low EC indicates a low concentration of nutrients [44]. When plants are supplied with a high EC nutrient solution, the nutrient concentration within the leaves will not necessarily be higher than in plants supplied with a low EC nutrient solution [45], suggesting that the nutrient uptake in plants is not necessarily based on the amount of nutrients available.

The role of irrigated farming in the livelihood of a nation cannot be underscored. In South Africa in particular, agricultural sector uses the highest volume of water compared to other sectors. To increase the amount of water needed in other critical sector of the economy, there is the need to improve on water use efficiency during irrigation through reduced water consumption without compromising yield. Regrettably, the concept of irrigation efficiency is often misinterpreted leading to the general belief that water just evaporates with minimal irrigation efficiencies and re-emerges with significant progress in agricultural productivity [49]. This necessitated the emergence of the South African water management framework which oversees holistically, the water source, the irrigation farm, bulk conveyance system and the irrigation scheme to ensure water balance across all sectors [49].

Although changes in the synthesis of desired natural compounds is clear when drought stress is applied to plants, the overall effect of applying drought stress for optimizing specific secondary metabolites in plants remains complex. The amount of water also influences other relevant factors such as plant biomass yield and rate of growth. Depending on the plant and the growers’ desired outcome with regards to quality, quantity, and rate of growth, the amount of water applied should be carefully considered as there is no prevalent recommendation that can be made for all plants. By deliberately applying drought-stress without first thoroughly investigating how different plants react to different amounts of water and the method of applying it could yield undesirable results [51].
