        "text": "It is probable that plants of the genus Sceletium (Mesembryanthemaceae) have been used as masticatories and for the relief of thirst and hunger, to combat fatigue, as medicines, and for social and spiritual purposes by San hunter-gatherers (historically referred to as Bushmen) and Khoi pastoralists (historically referred to as Hottentots) for millennia before the earliest written reports of the uses of these plants by European explorers and settlers. The oral-tradition knowledge of the uses of Sceletium by indigenous peoples has largely been eroded over the last three centuries due to conflicts with settlers, genocidal raids against the San, loss of land, the ravages of introduced diseases, and acculturation. Wild resources of Sceletium have also been severely diminished by over-harvesting, poor veld-management, and possibly also by plant diseases. Sceletium was reviewed almost a decade ago and new results have emerged substantiating some of the traditional uses of one of South Africa’s most coveted botanical assets, and suggesting dietary supplement, phytomedicine and new drug applications. This review aims to collate the fragmented information on past and present uses, the alkaloid chemistry and pharmacological evidence generated on Sceletium. ",

More than a decade has passed since the first ethnopharmacological review of this genus by Smith et al. (1996). There have since been significant advances in all aspects of Sceletium research, and an increasing number of commercial Sceletium products have appeared in the market place. Commercial Sceletium plantations have been established to address the need for sustainable supplies of standardised high quality raw material. The purpose of this review is to provide a short historical overview together with a comprehensive summary of past and recent developments in the chemistry, pharmacology, veterinary and clinical applications of Sceletium, and to highlight the lacunae in our present knowledge of this fascinating endemic South African succulent genus.

Brown. This group of plants is characterised by the skeletonised leaf venation pattern visible in dried leaves (Fig. 1). In 1986, Bittrich argued for a broader circumscription of Phyllobolus which included Sceletium as one of five subgenera. Since Gerbaulet was unable to find a synapomorphy (a unique derived character) for Bittrich’s broad concept of Phyllobolus, she reinstated Sceletium as a genus (Gerbaulet, 1996). Using molecular techniques in combination with morphological characters, Klak et al. (2007) proposed a much expanded generic concept, whereby a single genus, Mesembryanthemum (including Sceletium), is recognized in the Mesembryanthemoideae. (For the purpose of this review Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E. Br. (=Mesembryanthemum tortuosum L.) will be used). ",

The species are distinguished on the basis of vegetative, flower, fruit and seed characteristics. In this revision several species are reduced to synonymy including Sceletium joubertii L. Bol., and Sceletium namaquense L. Bol. now considered to be part of Sceletium tortuosum. Sceletium exhibits a climbing or decumbent habit and have characteristic succulent leaves with “bladder cells” or idioblasts. The flowers range from white, yellow to pale pink (Fig. 2). The fruit capsule contains numerous kidney-shaped seeds which are brown to black in color. The genus is distributed in the south-western parts of South Africa and has an affinity for arid environments (Fig. 3).

There are two surviving copies of the painting, originally made by the apothecary Hendrik Claudius who accompanied this expedition, one in a collection at the library of Trinity College, Dublin (Waterhouse et al., 1979) and one in a volume of water colors known as the Codex Witsenii at the South African Museum in Cape Town (Wijnands et al., 1996). Both paintings show a flower typical of Sceletium as well as the characteristic skeletonised old lower leaves from which the genus name Sceletium is derived (Jackson, 1990).

However there is no historical or extant evidence to suggest that Salsola species have masticatory, hunger- and thirstrelieving, mood-enhancing or other properties valued in Sceletium. In 1662, the Namaquas gave kanna and sheep to the Dutch in exchange for gifts, and the Commander of the Cape of Good Hope, Jan van Riebeek, regarded kanna as similar to ginseng (Smith, 1966). ",

This area of South Africa is still known as Cannaland at the present time. According to Thunberg (Forbes, 1986): “Kon, was a name given by the Hottentots to a shrub which grew here (Mesembryanthemum emarcidum) [now Sceletium emarcidum] and was famous all over the country. The Hottentots came far and near to fetch this shrub with the root, stalk and leaves which they stamp together, and afterwards twist them up like pig-tail tobacco; after which they let the mass ferment, and keep it by them for chewing, especially when they are thirsty. If chewed immediately after fermentation, it intoxicates. The word kon is said to signify a quid; the colonists call it canna root. It is found in the driest fields only, and is gathered chiefly by the Hottentots, who live near this spot. These afterwards hawke it about, frequently to a great distance, and exchange it for cattle and other commodities.” In this passage, Thunberg himself identifies the plant as Mesembryanthemum emarcidum, now Sceletium emarcidum. Thunberg further reported that the San “first chew canna (Mesembryanthemum), and afterwards smoke it”. The notes to this passage by the editor identifies canna as “various species of Sceletium, especially Sceletium tortuosum (Mesembryanthemaceae), esteemed for their narcotic properties when chewed or smoked” (Forbes, 1986).

It has a small seed, so it blows to places where it is stopped, and it lies there and grows. . .. The plant grows in winter, when the rains come. In the summer when the growing is over, and the leaves get yellowish and wilted, it is at its best. At the end of the growing season when most of the leaves are dead, then it is more powerful. It still work when its green, but it is very juicy, and you will lose a lot through the juice that drains out. You pick the kougoed, cut off the root, and crush it with a rock, put it in a plastic bag, and tie it tightly. You can leave it in the sun to get warm. It is not necessary to keep it in the shade, it gets shade at night, and the sun doesn’t harm it. The plant is left to sweat. After two to three days you mix it all together, and close it up again for another five to six days. On the eighth day after crushing you open it and spread out to dry in the sun as when you dry raisins. You leave it out until it is dry. If you do not do the whole process, the plant won’t have power. . .. Small plants are not picked and are left for the following season. If you want to make kougoed for immediate use you can make a fire, scrape a hollow in the sand, put in [the freshly picked plant], cover with hot sand and leave for an hour. ",

(1982) categorises the various Sceletium alkaloids into four structural groups: (1) the 3aaryl-cis-octahydroindole class (e.g. mesembrine), (2) the C-seco mesembrine alkaloids (e.g. joubertiamine), (3) alkaloids containing a 2,3-disubstituted pyridine moiety and 2 nitrogen atoms (e.g. Sceletium alkaloid A4) and (4) a ring C-seco Sceletium alkaloid A4 group (e.g. tortuosamine). The revision of Gerbaulet (1996) recognizes 8 species of Sceletium of which Sceletium strictum, Sceletium subvelutum (=Sceletium varians), Sceletium tortuosum, Sceletium joubertii and Sceletium namaquense have been studied exhaustively for their alkaloid composition. The latter two species are now considered synonyms of Sceletium tortuosum. Taking into consideration that the local utilization of Sceletium has included a number of species, that chemotypic variation is possible within a species, and that there is continued debate around the taxonomic nomenclature of the various taxa (and the Mesembryanthemaceae in general), all compounds that have been isolated from the genus Sceletium have been included, and presented in Fig. 6.

This was followed by the work of Zwicky (1914), who isolated several alkaloids including mesembrine and mesembrenine. It is believed that plant material of Sceletium tortuosum and Sceletium expansum was sent by Dr. Rudolf Marloth in South Africa to Prof. C. Hartwich in Zurich. The material was requested for E. Zwicky, a student of Prof. Hartwich who produced a dissertation “Über channa” in 1914. Rimington and Roets (1937) and later Popelak and Lettenbauer (1967) suggest that the “mesembrine” described by Zwicky was perhaps not a pure substance and corrected the molecular formula for mesembrine (C16H19O4N) first proposed by Zwicky. The correct formula (C17H23NO3) was later confirmed in the early 1960’s by the well-known German pharmaceutical company C.F. Boehringer and Soehne, and also by S.B. Penick in New York (Herre, 1971).

        "text": "Popelak and Lettenbauer (1967) assembled all the research on Sceletium alkaloids in their book chapter dedicated to mesembrine alkaloids. In this comprehensive publication they elaborate on the isolation and synthesis of mesembrine, mesembrenine (=mesembrenone), mesembrinol (=mesembranol) and the probable artifact chinnamine. Jeffs and co-workers, based at Duke University in North Carolina (USA), worked extensively on the isolation and structural elucidation of Sceletium alkaloids and reported several novel structures between 1969 and 1982. The absolute configuration of the epimeric alcohols mesembranol and 6-epimesembranol was reported (Jeffs et al., 1969). In 1970, Jeffs et al. reported on the isolation and structural elucidation of some novel alkaloids from Sceletium strictum. Mesembranol (the major alkaloid) and its acetylated derivative, 4′-O-acetylmesembrenol was isolated together with 4′-O-demethylmesembrenol and 4′-Odemethylmesembranol. In addition to these new structures, previously isolated alkaloids were also mentioned, including mesembrine and mesembrenone. In the same year, Arndt and Kruger reported four alkaloids from Sceletium joubertii (now reduced to synonymy under Sceletium tortuosum). Joubertiamine represented a new structural class different from the known mesembranes. Joubertiamine, dehydrojoubertiamine and dihydrojoubertiamine were all referred to as the seco-mesembranes. In the same study, the structurally unrelated alkaloid, hordenine, was isolated. Continuing their work on Sceletium alkaloids, Jeff et al. (1971) reported a new alkaloid skeleton from Sceletium namaquense. Sceletium alkaloid A4 was characterised by a 2,3-disubstituted pyridine moiety. This structure was alluded to by Popelak and Lettenbauer (1967), and confirmed to be the same compound described by Jeff et al. (1971). Parallel to the publication of Jeff et al. (1971) South African scientists also isolated and reported the structure of Sceletium alkaloid A4 together with tortuosamine, both obtained from Sceletium tortuosum (Snyckers et al., 1971). In an attempt to unravel the biosynthetic pathway of the mesembrine-type alkaloids, Jeffs et al. (1974) isolated minor constituents from Sceletium namaquense (=Sceletium tortuosum) and Sceletium strictum. From the former species, \u00027- mesembrenone and N-formyltortuosamine were isolated while 4′-O-demethylmesembrenone together with sceletenone were isolated from Sceletium strictum. Using a combination of spectroscopic and X-ray methods, Capps et al. (1977) resolved the structure and absolute stereochemistry of ( )-mesembrane and 3′-methoxy4′-O-methyljoubertiamine isolated from Sceletium namaquense. Five new alkaloids were isolated from Sceletium namaquense and described by Jeffs et al. (1982). Three compounds resemble the joubertiamine molecule and were named 4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[2-acetylmethylamino)ethyl]cyclohexanone, 4-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-4-[2-(acetylmethylamino)ethyl]cyclohexadienone and (−)-3′-methoxy-4′-O-methyljoubertiaminol. The structure of an unnamed alkaloid with a molecular formula of C20H26O3 and related to Sceletium alkaloid A4 was isolated together with N-acetyltortuosamine. Working on Sceletium subvelutinum (=Sceletium varians) Herbert and Kattah (1990) reported joubertiamine and five derivatives of this molecule. ",

(1998a,b) mimicked the traditional fermentation process by bruising plant material together with some soil, and sealing this in a plastic bag for a period of time. The study reported a substantial increase in total alkaloid yield and the GC–MS profiles indicated that the ratios of compounds had changed during the fermentation process. It was also reported that mesembrine levels decreased with a corresponding increase in the levels of mesembrenone. This experiment was unfortunately carried out using different individual plants for the various experiments, so it is possible that the results observed were due to chemotypic variation between the plants, rather than the type of processing the material was subjected to. Using a similar approach Viljoen (2007, unpublished data) subdivided the aerial parts of a single robust plant into three portions. The three parts were processed as follows: (1) fresh material crushed under liquid nitrogen and transferred to a freeze drier for 36 h, (2) fresh material crushed under liquid nitrogen and the alkaloids immediately extracted and (3) fresh material gently bruised and dried at 50 ◦C for 48 h. The experiment was repeated five times. The alkaloids were extracted using an acid–base extraction method and the alkaloids were monitored by GC–MS. Analytical pure standards of mesembrenol, mesembrine and mesembrenone were used to confirm the identity of the various peaks. There was no significant difference in both total alkaloid yield as well as alkaloid ratios between the three treatments. A similar experiment will need to be devised to establish whether the traditional fermentation process, or traditional baking, does in fact influence Sceletium alkaloids quantitatively and/or qualitatively.

As is the case with most natural products, alkaloids are subjected to intrinsic and extrinsic factors which govern their production and accumulation in plants. These factors have yet to be explored in Sceletium. Furthermore, Sceletium taxonomy has remained a topic of contention between modern taxonomists, challenging the taxonomic authenticity of the species from which alkaloids have previously been isolated. The various studies cited above clearly highlight congruencies and anomalies in the past and present information recorded for the various taxa emphasising the urgent need for a thorough biosystematic study of the entire genus, and including adequate sampling across the entire distribution range for each species.

The patient was started on a tablet of 50 mg Sceletium daily. The patient initially reported a transient increase in anxiety after taking medication, which would last up to 3 h, but was no longer apparent after the first week of treatment. A sustained improvement in mood was reported, with a marked decrease in generalised anxiety. The patient’s insomnia improved at the onset of treatment.

There was no suicidal ideation, but mood was depressed alternating with anxiety, and there was loss of motivation and interest, with hypersomnia. In addition to ongoing therapy, Sceletium was recommended as a tablet of 50 mg daily. Within 10 days the patient said that her mood had lifted, and she was able to feel more focused, more engaged and not so socially “distant”. She doubled her dose of Sceletium to two 50 mg tablets daily just prior to her exams a month later, and described feeling less anxious and more able to cope with her usual examination anxiety. An interesting development on Sceletium was that the client described feeling less inclined to over-indulge in alcohol. The conclusion was made that while the client had personality problems that required ongoing therapy, the Sceletium had helped her feel more contained, had lifted her mood, and had also helped with the anxiety.

The spectrum of uses are likely to be dose-dependent, with the lowest doses of active alkaloids at the simple masticatory side of the spectrum of uses, and the highest doses at the intoxicating end of the spectrum. It is instructive that elderly rural users of kougoed in Namaqualand remove the quid of Sceletium well before any intoxication is experienced, and it is common to re-use the same piece of chewing material as and when they feel like it. This traditional use as a simple masticatory would seem to suggest that very little alkaloid is in fact ingested or absorbed. ",

The in vitro activity of mesembrine as a PDE4 inhibitor is another mechanism whereby Sceletium may act as an antidepressant, and suggests additional therapeutic potential. The pharmacological study of Sceletium is still in its infancy, however, and a great deal of work remains to be done. We do not yet know whether these two activities will also be found for other Sceletium alkaloids, and if so, which compounds will have the most potent and selective activities. While the focus of pharmacological research for over 100 years has been on the alkaloids, the non-alkaloid components have been neglected, and may provide an entirely new field for Sceletium research.
