        "text": "Abstract – Purpose. Sceletium plant species have been reported to contain psychoactive alkaloids, specifically belonging to mesembrine-type alkaloids. Sceletium is presently marketed through health shops and on the internet as dried plant powder and as pharmaceutical dosage forms and purported to be useful in the treatment of psychological disorders. However, there are no validated analytical methods and reference standards of the relevant alkaloids are not commercially available for use in the analysis and quality control of Sceletium products and dosage forms. Hence, the objective of this research was to isolate and characterize appropriate analytical markers for use in the assay and as well as markers for fingerprinting by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Methods. The separation of the relevant alkaloids was carried out on a C18 column and detected at a UV wavelength of $2 2 8 \\mathrm { n m }$ . The method was validated and used to assay the mesembrine-type alkaloids namely $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone, mesembranol, mesembrenone, mesembrine and epimesembranol. Results. The calibration curves were found to be linear over the entire concentration range of $4 0 0 { \\cdot } 6 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n g / m l }$ with correlation coefficients ${ > } 0 . 9 9$ . The accuracies of the relevant alkaloids were found to be between 94.8 and $1 0 3 . 6 \\%$ with an inter-day relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than $2 . 8 \\%$ . The precision studies showed inter-day RSD’s of less than $3 \\%$ . The recoveries were all within the range of 95 and $10 5 \\%$ $( \\mathrm { R S D } { < } 4 . 5 \\%$ ) and the limits of quantitation (LOQ) and detection (LOD) were found to be 100 and $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n g / m l } }$ respectively using the respective S/N ratios of 3 and 10. Conclusions. An HPLC method for the quantitative analysis of $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone, mesembranol, mesembrenone, mesembrine and epimesembranol in Sceletium plant material has been developed and validated. This assay method can be applied for the quality control of Sceletium plant material which is used as an African Traditional Medicine for the treatment of psychological disorders. ",

        "text": "Evaluation of natural products for their chemical components is challenging due to the inherent diversity of their chemical composition. Separation techniques and their application to evaluate specific chemical components of natural products is an important aspect which permits accurate characterization and quantification. It has been reported that almost $80 \\%$ of known natural substances are non-volatile and thermolabile, which makes high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultra violet (UV) detection the most commonly used analytical technique for natural products (1). Photo diode array (PDA) detectors enhance the versatility of the analysis by allowing multi-wavelength detection of compounds based on their distinct chromophore active regions. PDA is thus particularly useful for multi-component sample analysis since one sample can usually provide sufficient data to assess the purity of the individual components (2). There are many reports on the use of HPLC for qualitative analysis of herbal medicines, more importantly for the fingerprinting of South African traditional medicines (3). In addition, chromatographic fingerprinting has been widely accepted and recommended by various regulatory authorities such as WHO (4), US-FDA (5), EMEA (6) and MHRA (7) to assess the consistency of batch to batch dosage forms containing phytochemical components of the harvested plants.

In all three methods, the samples were prepared by dissolving the extracts in a minimum quantity of methanol. The first method is mentioned as a “fast system” for “large number of samples”. The method uses a DB-1 fused silica capillary column $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ x ~ } 0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ i.d, with helium as carrier gas. The column temperature was maintained isothermally at $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for 15 minutes and then programmed at $1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C / m i n }$ to $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ The injector and the flame ionization detector were maintained at $2 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ respectively (9). A second method is mentioned as “high resolution analyses” for “selected samples”. The method also uses a DB-1 column and helium as carrier gas, similar to the first method. The column temperature was isothermally maintained at $1 5 0 \\mathrm { { } ^ { \\circ } C }$ for 15 minutes and then programmed at $6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } /$ min to $3 2 0 \\mathrm { { } ^ { \\circ } C }$ . The injector and the NPD were maintained at $2 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ respectively (9). A third method mentioned is for GC-MS analysis, with the column, carrier gas and the temperatures maintained similar to the second method. The MS conditions were not described (9). The patent also includes an HPLC method using a reversed phase system ( $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 8 }$ column). The mobile phase comprised $30 \\%$ trimethylamine solution ( $1 \\%$ in water) and $70 \\%$ acetonitrile solution $60 \\%$ in water) at a flow rate of $1 ~ \\mathrm { m l }$ per minute.
