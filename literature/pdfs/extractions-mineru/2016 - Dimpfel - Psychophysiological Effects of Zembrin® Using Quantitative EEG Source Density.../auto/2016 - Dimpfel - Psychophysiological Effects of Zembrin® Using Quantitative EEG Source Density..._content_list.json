This combination of EEG Neurocode-Tracking and Eye-Tracking allows for concomitant analysis of time epochs of only 364 ms duration. Spectral EEG analysis during cognitive and emotional challenges revealed statistically significant increases of delta (p < 0.01 during arithmetic calculation and watching a boring animal video) and theta spectral power (p < 0.10 during these same challenges) in the presence of Zembrin® within the frontal brain. It is these same increases of slow waves in the frontal brain that are described in the literature during performance of mental tests. This indicates a positive effect of Zembrin® on the electrical activity of the brain during cognitive processing. In addition, alpha1 and alpha2 spectral power in the frontal brain was increased during several challenges including brain teasing, arithmetic calculations and performance of a memory test.

Follow-up connectivity analysis on the emotion matching task demonstrated that amygdale-hypothalamus coupling was also reduced. These results demonstrated for the first time the attenuating effects of Sceletium tortuosum on the threat circuitry of the human brain and provide supporting evidence that the dual 5-HT reuptake inhibition and PDE4 inhibition of Zembrin might have anxiolytic potential by attenuating the sub-cortical threat response [8].

With respect to the central nervous system, neurotransmitter receptors represent a major drug target. Interaction of drugs with these molecules induces a signaling cascade, which finally ends up with the control of ion channel conductance. Since the electric activity of single neurons depends on the set of momentarily active ion channels, communication between neurons is governed by channel activity. From here, it is obvious that electrical field potentials contain the net information of larger local networks of electrically active neurons, reflecting the interaction of drugs with their targets within the concert of neurotransmission.

The relationship between EEG delta waves and cholinergic neurotransmission was first recognized in 2005 [12], and it was recognized that theta waves are influenced by drugs acting at the biochemically defined norepinephrine alpha2 receptor [13]. Presynaptic interaction with this receptor leads to drowsiness and sleep, and increases of theta waves have been used as part of a formula describing depth of sleep in humans.

A new modified software for analysis of shorter time epochs of 364 ms duration was used (neo-CATEEM , supplied by MEWICON CATEEM-Tec GmbH, 4164 Schwarzenberg, Austria). A manuscript containing details and validation of the software package—now called “Neurocode-Tracking”—has been published [20]. In short: For the present new approach, the EEG frequency ranges to be analyzed had to be adjusted slightly to give the following exact ranges. Delta: 1.375 - 4.125 Hz; Theta: 4.125 - 6.875 Hz; Alpha1: 6.875 - 9.625 Hz; Alpha2: 9.625 - 12.375 Hz; Beta1: 12.375 - 17.875 Hz; Beta2: 17.875 - 34.375 Hz. This adjustment is a precondition for the new fast dynamic frequency analysis (Neurocode-Tracking) because under this condition each frequency range from delta up to alpha2 contains only one frequency (middle frequency within the particular frequency band). Data were analyzed in the current source density mode [21]. All other features remained identical to the classic analysis currently in use for nearly 20 years [17].

For offline analysis and synchronization with the eye-track data a screen grabber (Adobe Captivate) was used to produce a video containing all successively calculated EEG maps of 364 ms duration. A second video was obtained from the eye-tracker software running on a separate computer. It is called a “gaze overlay” movie depicting the presented pictures, tasks or video films. In this gaze overlay video the momentary gaze of the subject is documented by a red spot. The presentation always started with an audio signal (gong). This audio signal was registered by screen capture of the EEG computer and was used for synchronization of both videos by means of a video cut software (Adobe Premiere Pro). Due to the processing time of the brain (300 to 400 ms) plus that of the computer (depends individually on the type and number of active processors!) the gaze overlay video is shifted in our case (quad core, 3.4 Giga-Hz) for one second in order to obtain synchronized images between gaze and the particular EEG epoch of 364 ms. For detailed offline documentation a movie was exported and analyzed image by image. Single representative images containing the gaze and corresponding EEG map (called an Enkephaloglyph [21]) were cut from the screen by a video editing software tool available on all computers. ",

Sixty subjects were exposed to a series of mental tasks and emotional audio-visual video-clips before and 2 hours after intake of 25.0 or 50.0 mg of Zembrin® or placebo (for timeline s. Figure 1). After synchronization of the EEG video and the eye track video by means of the “gong” at the beginning of the experiment one can compare scene by scene of the combined video with respect to placebo intake or intake of the two doses of Zembrin®. Representative examples for evaluation of single scenes and a group evaluation during the picture comparison and during performance of brain teasers are documented in Figures 2-5, respectively. ",

        "text": "An important issue with regard to interpretation of quantitative EEG features is to discriminate between socalled baseline activity recorded during a relaxed state (usually with eyes open) and during sensory input or under mental load. As shown in 1974 [23] and later [24] as well as in the 1990’s. Schober [25], cognitive processing induced prominent increases of frontal spectral delta and theta power. This has also been verified using the newly developed methodology of EnkephaloVision [18], and in addition to increases of delta and theta power within the frontal brain, increases of beta power in temporal and parietal regions were observed. Spectral delta power is usually accepted to be related to sleep [26], however during sleep the extent of increase is much higher and occurs in all brain regions, whereas delta increase during mental loads is restricted to the frontal brain. Interestingly, higher delta and theta power have been related to estimation of mental energy versus tiredness, where increases indicated higher mental energy [27]. It has been even suggested that psychometric testing could be replaced by direct measurement of quantitative EEG using source density analysis [28]. ",

Spectral theta oscillations have also been described earlier by other authors during a working memory task [30]. The present investigation revealed that the same frequencies in the same brain regions were changed in the presence of Zembrin . Increases of delta and theta spectral power in the frontal brain indicate stronger mental activation, and in the presence of Zembrin® this happens to occur during cognitive and emotional challenges to a significant degree in comparison to placebo.

Higher spectral alpha1 power indicates relaxation and a higher degree of calmness [31]. In addition, there is evidence from a study in Parkinson patients that those suffering from depressive symptomatology showed significantly lower absolute alpha1 spectral power [32]. The increase observed in the presence of Zembrin may be interpreted as a positive effect on calmness and mood. ",

In addition to theta power, alpha2 power in particular has been related to memory processes [33] [34]. Since spectral alpha power has been used to discriminate patients with mild cognitive impairment from controls during a memory working task [35], it can be extrapolated that Zembrin may have a positive influence on memory related brain processes.

The additional increases of beta2 power as observed in the temporal, parietal and occipital region during this experimental seriesi.e. during performance of arithmetic calculation in the presence of the higher dosage of Zembrin® may therefore indicate a positive action of Zembrin® on those electrical circuits involved during cognitive processing. This reasoning is underlined by a positive tendency with respect to psychometric performance in the presence of both dosages of Zembrin . Possibly, the duration of the different tasks was too short to unravel statistically significant actions. ",

In comparison to placebo, Zembrin® induced enhanced increases in power of frontal delta, theta, alpha1 and alpha2 frequencies during several tasks. Since increases in these frequencies in the frontal brain have been related to attention and memory, these results may represent a positive dose dependent action of Zembrin® on cognitive and emotional processes in the brain.
