The plant has been used as a tea and as a masticatory for millennia by indigenous San hunter-gatherers and Nama pastoralists for endurance and well-being. It has been reported that the plant “gives strength to their limbs, and takes away pain, and makes their memory strong”. The current investigation aimed at the psychophysiological characterization of 25.0 and $\\mathbf { 5 0 . 0 \\ m g }$ of a special extract marketed as Zembrin® in comparison to placebo using a new methodology called “EnkephaloVision”. This combination of EEG Neurocode-Tracking and Eye-Tracking allows for concomitant analysis of time epochs of only $3 6 4 ~ \\mathrm { m } s$ duration. Spectral EEG analysis during cognitive and emotional challenges revealed statistically significant increases of delta $\\bf ( p < 0 . 0 1$ during arithmetic calculation and watching a boring animal video) and theta spectral power $\\bf ( p < 0 . 1 0$ during these same challenges) in the presence of Zembrin® within the frontal brain. It is these same increases of slow waves in the frontal brain that are described in the literature during performance of mental tests. This indicates a positive effect of Zembrin® on the electrical activity of the brain during cognitive processing. In addition, alpha1 and alpha2 spectral power in the frontal brain was increased during several challenges including brain teasing, arithmetic calculations and performance of a memory test. From the literature, increases of spectral alpha1 power indicate a greater degree of calmness and may represent decreased depressive symptoms, while increases in alpha2 waves have been related to memory. Beta2 waves increased during mental performance in the presence of the higher dosage of Zembrin® in parietal, occipital and temporal brain regions. In comparison to placebo, Zembrin® induced frequency changes in the brain, which have been related to enhanced attention and memory. These results may represent a positive action of Zembrin® on cognitive and emotional processes in the brain. ",

Amygdala reactivity to fearful faces under low perceptual load conditions was attenuated after a single $2 5 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ dose of Zembrin®. Follow-up connectivity analysis on the emotion matching task demonstrated that amygdale-hypothalamus coupling was also reduced. These results demonstrated for the first time the attenuating effects of Sceletium tortuosum on the threat circuitry of the human brain and provide supporting evidence that the dual 5-HT reuptake inhibition and PDE4 inhibition of Zembrin® might have anxiolytic potential by attenuating the sub-cortical threat response [8].

With respect to the central nervous system, neurotransmitter receptors represent a major drug target. Interaction of drugs with these molecules induces a signaling cascade, which finally ends up with the control of ion channel conductance. Since the electric activity of single neurons depends on the set of momentarily active ion channels, communication between neurons is governed by channel activity. From here, it is obvious that electrical field potentials contain the net information of larger local networks of electrically active neurons, reflecting the interaction of drugs with their targets within the concert of neurotransmission.

Interpretation of the results is made with respect to the likely underlying neurotransmitter activity responsible for changes in the selected frequency ranges, and aims at advancing an understanding of possible clinical applications in humans. The relationship between EEG delta waves and cholinergic neurotransmission was first recognized in 2005 [12], and it was recognized that theta waves are influenced by drugs acting at the biochemically defined norepinephrine alpha2 receptor [13]. Presynaptic interaction with this receptor leads to drowsiness and sleep, and increases of theta waves have been used as part of a formula describing depth of sleep in humans. Dopaminergic activity is reflected by changes in alpha2 frequencies [14]. ",

        "text": "In this study a 17-channel EEG recording was combined with Eye-Tracking. Details of the EEG recording method have been published earlier [19]. A new modified software for analysis of shorter time epochs of $3 6 4 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ duration was used (neo-CATEEM®, supplied by MEWICON CATEEM-Tec GmbH, 4164 Schwarzenberg, Austria). A manuscript containing details and validation of the software package—now called “Neurocode-Tracking”—has been published [20]. In short: For the present new approach, the EEG frequency ranges to be analyzed had to be adjusted slightly to give the following exact ranges. Delta: $1 . 3 7 5 \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 4 . 1 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ ; Theta: 4.125 - $6 . 8 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ ; Alpha1: $6 . 8 7 5 \\textrm { -- } 9 . 6 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ ; Alpha2: $9 . 6 2 5 \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 2 . 3 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ ; Beta1: $1 2 . 3 7 5 \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 7 . 8 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { H z } ;$ ; Beta2: 17.875 - $3 4 . 3 7 5 \\mathrm { H z }$ . This adjustment is a precondition for the new fast dynamic frequency analysis (Neurocode-Tracking) because under this condition each frequency range from delta up to alpha2 contains only one frequency (middle frequency within the particular frequency band). Data were analyzed in the current source density mode [21]. All other features remained identical to the classic analysis currently in use for nearly 20 years [17]. Maps were constructed by transforming spectral power values into spectral colors followed by additive color mixture (RGB-mode as in TV). ",

All mental and emotional challenges were presented as a single video clip. Single challenges were first constructed as a Power Point file and then converted into a final video clip (by Adobe Captivate software). For offline analysis and synchronization with the eye-track data a screen grabber (Adobe Captivate) was used to produce a video containing all successively calculated EEG maps of $3 6 4 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ duration. A second video was obtained from the eye-tracker software running on a separate computer. It is called a “gaze overlay” movie depicting the presented pictures, tasks or video films. In this gaze overlay video the momentary gaze of the subject is documented by a red spot. The presentation always started with an audio signal (gong). This audio signal was registered by screen capture of the EEG computer and was used for synchronization of both videos by means of a video cut software (Adobe Premiere Pro). Due to the processing time of the brain (300 to $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } } ,$ ) plus that of the computer (depends individually on the type and number of active processors!) the gaze overlay video is shifted in our case (quad core, 3.4 Giga-Hz) for one second in order to obtain synchronized images between gaze and the particular EEG epoch of $3 6 4 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ . For detailed offline documentation a movie was exported and analyzed image by image. Single representative images containing the gaze and corresponding EEG map (called an Enkephaloglyph [21]) were cut from the screen by a video editing software tool available on all computers. ",

For exploratory statistical evaluation the non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used. For mathematical differentiation of the different mental loads linear discriminant analysis according to Fischer was used. Results from the first three discriminant functions were projected into space (X, Y and Z coordinates), whereas results from the fourth to sixth discriminant functions were coded into red, green and blue color, respectively, followed an additive color mixture (so-called RGB-mode). In order to document statistically the different electric reaction of the brain to various cognitive and emotional loads, data from each part of the presentation were divided by the data obtained during fixation of the cross on the monitor (1 minute) at the beginning. Comparison of the effect of $2 5 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ , $5 0 . 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g \\ Z e m b r i n } ^ { \\mathbb { B } }$ capsules versus placebo was accomplished by evaluation of the second EEG recording of the day 120 minutes after intake.

For this goal data from each type of challenge were averaged over the total presentation time of cognitive or emotional challenges in order to follow each of the brain regions with respect to the pattern of spectral power changes with respect to each frequency. These data have been published separately [18]. In short: Mental activation in terms of functional anatomy was observed primarily in lateral forebrain as increases of delta and theta frequencies during all challenges starting with the boring animal video. The more complex the single challenges were, the more brain regions and frequencies became involved. In addition to the frontal brain areas, the temporal and parietal areas showed changes of electric brain activity in terms of increases (delta, theta and beta waves) or decreases (alpha waves in central regions).

As shown in 1974 [23] and later [24] as well as in the 1990’s. Schober [25], cognitive processing induced prominent increases of frontal spectral delta and theta power. This has also been verified using the newly developed methodology of EnkephaloVision [18], and in addition to increases of delta and theta power within the frontal brain, increases of beta power in temporal and parietal regions were observed. Spectral delta power is usually accepted to be related to sleep [26], however during sleep the extent of increase is much higher and occurs in all brain regions, whereas delta increase during mental loads is restricted to the frontal brain. Interestingly, higher delta and theta power have been related to estimation of mental energy versus tiredness, where increases indicated higher mental energy [27]. It has been even suggested that psychometric testing could be replaced by direct measurement of quantitative EEG using source density analysis [28]. ",
