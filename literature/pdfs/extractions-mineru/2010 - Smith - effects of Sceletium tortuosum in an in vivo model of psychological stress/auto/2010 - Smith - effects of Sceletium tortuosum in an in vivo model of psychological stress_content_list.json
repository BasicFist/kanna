In South Africa in particular, only about 15% of the population is covered by private medical aid systems (Eastman, 2005) and traditional healers outnumber “Western” doctors by at least 10 to 1 (Morris, 2001). Therefore it is not surprising that there is a tendency for patients to turn to traditional healers and traditional plant and herbal remedies. Research into the effects of traditional medicines in standardised models which can exclude the placebo effect, and elucidation of mechanisms of action of these products, may provide scientific proof of efficacy for a variety of ailments, so that these remedies may be used optimally, especially in developing countries where the majority of the population has no alternative for treatment.

        "text": "Sceletium tortuosum, a member of the family Mesembryanthemaceae (Smith et al., 1996), is one of the plants traditionally claimed to have sedative and anti-anxiety properties (Jin, 2009). The anecdotal evidence of efficacy of this plant, which occurs mainly in the eastern and western parts of South Africa, and which is traditionally known as “kougoed” or “kanna”, was recently comprehensively reviewed (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). A number of Japanese studies quoted in this review suggested a sedative effect in cats and dogs with dementia, but these studies did not seem to include control groups, so that it is not possible to make firm conclusions on efficacy from the limited information available. Similarly, a limited number of case reports suggest an anti-anxiety and anti-stress effect in humans (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). However, given the heavy burden of stress on society, these claims of positive effects from seemingly uncontrolled in vivo studies warrant formal investigation. ",

        "text": "In a recent review, the anecdotally reported anti-stress effects of Sceletium tortuosum was ascribed to the alkaloids contained in the plant, which includes mesembrine, mesembrenone, \u00027 mesembrenone, mesembranol and epi-mesembranol. In a report of previously unpublished data (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008), synthetically prepared mesembrine, one of the major alkaloids known to be present in Sceletium, was reported to selectively inhibit serotonin uptake in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Mesembrine isolated from Sceletium has also previously been reported to be weakly narcotic (Smith et al., 1996). However, a more recent report, elucidating the phytochemical content of Sceletium tortuosum in particular (Patnala and Kanfer, 2009), reported that a fermentation process, similar to the traditional preparation process anecdotally described (Smith et al., 1996), altered the alkaloid content of the plant material by transformation of mesembrine to \u00027 mesembrenone. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the effects ascribed to Sceletium are due to effects of the mesembrine or its transformed form. Since the traditional use of the plant includes a rudimentary fermentation process, it seems likely to be the latter. However, another report suggests that the fermentation process may decrease the amount of oxalates in the plant material, which may act as a gastric irritant, causing unwanted side-effects (Smith et al., 1996), which poses an alternative reason for traditional fermentation that is unrelated to its claimed anxiolytic effect. The current study therefore investigated the effects of unfermented Sceletium tortuosum in an established in vivo model of psychological stress (Smith et al., 2007), in a quest to evaluate the scientific merit of the claims made.

Leaves were collected from the source plant and used to prepare a 2:1 spray-dried aqueous–ethanolic extract (no fermentation, personal communication: Dr N. Gericke). Unfortunately no voucher specimen was lodged in a herbarium. Therefore, in order to put our study in context of the literature, we analysed the extract for its alkaloid content, using GC–MS techniques, based on the method described earlier (McCoy et al., 1983). Briefly, 1 ml chloroform and 1 ml 1 M HCl were added to 0.5 g plant material. The mixture was mixed vigorously and sonicated for 20 min. The mixture was centrifuged and the aqueous layer was removed and washed with one volume of chloroform. The aqueous layer was made basic with NaOH and extracted twice with chloroform. The chloroform layers (containing the alkaloids) were combined, dried with Na2SO4 and injected on to the GC–MS (Waters GCT Premier). Total ion chromatogram of the extracted material illustrated the presence of 4 alkaloid peaks, appearing at 12.40, 12.57, 12.96 and 13.37 min, respectively. By comparison to a standard, the relatively smallest peak, eluding at 12.96 min, was identified as mesembrine. This is in agreement with an earlier study, which also reported that mesembrine is not the dominant constituent in Sceletium (Smith et al., 1996). Plant material used in the current study was unfermented and uncrushed. Despite comprehensive search the literature, no mass spectra could be obtained for Sceletium plant material processed in the same way, or for the same alkaloids in other plant material. Due to the published effects of processing on the relative abundance of alkaloids in relation to each other, and the relative difficulty of obtaining suitable analytical reference standards (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008), no definite identification could be made of the other 3 alkaloid peaks in the current study. It is of interest to note that the electron impact mass spectra for these 3 peaks contained many corresponding substances, e.g. those with m/z of 70 and 218, as well as many close to 289 (Fig. 1), which places the unidentified alkaloids in the same structural category as mesembrine and \u00027 mesembrenone. However, definite identification will only be possible after more comprehensive analysis by experts in this area. ",

        "text": "Anecdotal evidence on the effect of Sceletium on behavior is varied, with quotes from a recent review ranging from symptoms such as “becoming excited and intoxicated” to the opposite, having “narcotic properties” or being a “good sedative” (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). In the same review, non-peer-reviewed data was presented to illustrate a dose-dependent effect of mesembrine (the main alkaloid to which the effect of Sceletium is ascribed) on serotonin (5-HT) uptake, where serotonin reuptake was reported to be inhibited in presence of mesembrine concentrations in excess of 1 8−8 M, without affecting reuptake of noradrenalin or dopamine. This result would seem to support the notion of a sedative effect. In our model of mild, psychological stress, changes in exploratory behavior seemed to point to an exacerbation of anxiety, rather than a calming effect. Although this response argues against the above-mentioned effect of mesembrine, it is in agreement with some anecdotal evidence of Sceletium-induced excitement, also mentioned earlier. In contrast, when considering the time spent grooming, a recognized “self-soothing” behavior (Judge et al., 2006), in the stressed rats treated with low-dose Sceletium, grooming time, although still elevated when compared to controls, was approximately 30% lower when compared to both placebo and high-dose treated stressed rats. Although not a statistically significant result, this may suggest a calming effect of the lower dose. However, from the current results, no clear conclusion can be drawn at this time. ",

        "text": "Although there was a clear response to stress in corticosterone levels, data did not indicate a statistically significant effect of Sceletium treatment on hormone levels. However, similar to the observation for grooming time, in the low-dose treated stressed group, corticosterone levels were approximately 20% lower when compared to the other two stressed groups. It is therefore possible that the usually high inter-individual variation in the corticosterone response to stress may have masked a stress-limiting effect, but a study on a much larger population is required to substantiate or refute this suggestion. The result of no effect on testosterone levels is a desired one, given the possibility of unwanted side-effects when anabolic homeostasis is disturbed (de Ronde, 2009; Thomas et al., 2008). ",

        "text": "IL-1\u0002 is known to be a potent inducer of corticosterone production via induction of CRH release (Watkins, 1994). Therefore, it is not surprising that stress was associated with an increase in the level of this cytokine. In terms of the claim made earlier (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008), that Sceletium may act as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) due to mesembrine action, the current data argues against this suggestion: IL-1\u0002 and TNF-\u0004 is known to stimulate serotonin uptake (Zhu et al., 2006), so that one might expect a decrease in these cytokines after treatment with a SSRI. However, the current data indicate an effect of treatment to increase IL-1\u0002 levels, and having no effect on average TNF-\u0004 levels. Unfortunately serotonin levels could not be assessed in the current study, so that the mechanism by which Sceletium may potentially exert positive effects on behavior and corticosterone levels as discussed above, as well as anecdotally claimed, remains to be scientifically elucidated.

        "text": "Arguably the most common indicator of inflammation used by researchers, the acute phase protein CRP, showed clear effects of treatment, with CRP levels increasing significantly in a Sceletium dose-dependent manner in control rats. This response was not evident in the stressed rats, possibly due to the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosterone, which was increased by more than 5-fold in response to restraint stress. This parameter (CRP) indicates the presence of inflammation, but more precise causes of this relatively general response can be elucidated by assessment of the circulating cytokine profile. ",

        "text": "IL-1\u0002 is commonly known to also play a major role in the inflammatory response (Peakman and Vergani, 2009; Roitt, 1994). Other cytokine levels assessed supports the notion of an inflammatory response to the supplement. For example, prostaglandin E2 level changes mirrored the treatment effect evident for CRP and IL-1\u0002. Since IL-1\u0002 is known to stimulate release of PGE2 release (Jana et al., 2008), this result is not unexpected, given the treatment-induced increase in IL-1\u0002 levels. In a similar scenario to that of IL-1\u0002, chronic mild restraint stress is also known to increase gastric and colonic secretion of PGE2 (Castagliuolo et al., 1996; Wallace and Cohen, 1984). PGE2 in turn is associated with rapid release of corticosterone from the adrenal glands (Mohn et al., 2005). In the current stress protocol of relatively short duration, this effect of stress on PGE2 was not observed, suggesting that at the time of sacrifice (24 after the last restraint exposure) the transient restraint-induced inflammation had been resolved. The result of no effect on TNF\u0004 levels at the time of sacrifice supports this notion. Therefore, the treatment effect reported here implies that an irritant contained in Sceletium may have given rise to a sustained inflammatory condition, characterized by increased gut secretion of PGE2. This possibility of an intolerance reaction is supported by observations of increased passing of loose stools by Sceletium-treated rats independent of stress, and could also fit in with the traditional use of Sceletium as a treatment for constipation (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008).

        "text": "Another important novel finding was the fact that Sceletium treatment decreased IL-2 levels in the presence of stress. IL-2 is known to increase in response to stress to activate the HPA-axis (Hanisch et al., 1996; Shikhevich et al., 2003). In the placebo group IL-2 levels did increase by almost 60% in response to stress, but this effect was attenuated in the low-dose treated group and even reversed in the high-dose group, where IL-2 levels decreased by 60% when compared to the placebo stressed group, and by 40% when compared to high-dose treated unstressed rats. This data may be interpreted in more than one way: firstly, it may suggest that Sceletium exerts an anti-anxiety effect by down-regulation of IL-2, and thus IL-2-associated HPA-axis activation. However, this is unlikely, since IL-2 was lowest in the high-dose treated rats, while the positive effect in terms of corticosterone and behavior was most evident in the low-dose treated rats. A second, more likely interpretation is that Sceletium, in particular the higher dose, enhanced the down-regulatory effect of corticosterone on the T helper 1 (Th1), or cell-mediated, immune response. The treatment also tended towards increasing levels of the Th2 (humoral) antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, independently of stress, again with highest average levels in the high-dose treated groups, providing further evidence of a Th1 immune-suppressive effect of the plant. This suppressive effect may in the longer term result in tolerance to Sceletium treatment, since increased IL-10 has been implicated in food intolerance and food hypersensitivity (Gray et al., 2004), with a stronger IL-10 response named as key factor in the development of tolerance to the initial irritant (Ng et al., 2002; Torres-Aguilar et al., 2010).
