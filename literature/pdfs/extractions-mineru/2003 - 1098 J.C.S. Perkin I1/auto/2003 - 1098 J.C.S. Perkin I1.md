# Sceletium Alkaloids. Part 7.1 Structure and Absolute Stereochemistry of (-)-Mesembrane and 3'-Methoxy-4'-O-methyljoubertiamine, Two Minor Bases from S. Namaquense L. Bolus: X-Ray Analysis of (-)- Mesembrane Hydrochloride Monohydrate

By Thomas M. Capps, Karl D. Hargrave,PeterW.Jeffs,\*and AndrewT.McPhail,\* Paul M. Gross Chemical Laboratory,Duke University,Durham,North Carolina 27706,U.S.A.

From S.namaquense L. Bolus,we have isolated the known base tortuosamine (7)and two new alkaloids.3'- methoxy-4'-O-methyljoubertiamine (6)and (-)-mesembrane (2) the structures of which have been established by spectroscopic and X-ray methods.Previous suggestions concerning the absolute configuration of alkaloids of the 3a-aryl-cis-octahydroindolering_systemare confirmedbyan X-rayanalysis_of (-)-mesembrane hydrochloridemonohydratewhichcrystalizesinthemonoclinicsystemspace groupP2witha=14.50(1).b=8.02(1). C = 7.57(1) A.β = 93.4(1)°.Z= 2. The crystal structure was solved by direct methods and refinedby leastsquares calculations to R O.O55 over 1158 reflections from difractometer measurements.The absolute configurationwas established bythe anomalous dispersion effect.The c.d.spectrum of (-)-mesembrine,considered as an axial β-aminoketone,is shown to exhibit normal octant behaviour.

PREvious investigations of the alkaloids of Sceletium namaquense L.Bolus have resulted in the isolation of bases belonging to the mesembrine group and the pyridino-octahydroindole class exemplified by the base sceletium alkaloid A4 (l).² Further studies of the nonphenolic alkaloids from S.namaquense which are described herein have led to the isolation of two new alkaloids，(-)-mesembrane (2) and 3'-methoxy-4'-Omethyljoubertiamine (6)，and the known base tortuosamine (7).3

Column chromatographic fractions derived from separation of the non-phenolic alkaloids overalumina followed bymethanol (31)were collected and combined into six major fractions [(I)--(VI)] based upon the results of analysis by g.l.c.and t.l.c. The alkaloid tortuosamine

(7)，previously described by Wiechers and co-workers, was isolated from polar fraction (VI). Identification of this compound followed from its characteristic 1H n.m.r. spectral properties and confirmation was obtained by direct spectral and chromatographic comparisons made with an authentic sample obtained by hydrolysis of N-formyltortuosamine (see Experimental section).

Fraction (III) (2.3 g),comprising mesembrenone and sceletium alkaloid A4 as major components，also contained an unidentified component on g.l.c. Extensive preparative chromatography of this fraction on both silica gel and alumina afforded ca.loo mg of a non-crystalline base. The presence of a·CH:CH·CO chromophore in this compound was indicated by the 1H n.m.r. spectrum which contained a pair of doublets at δ 6.l2 and 7.09 (J 10 Hz) and by the presence of a carbonyl band at 1 680 cm-1in the i.r.spectrum. An unresolved multiplet at δ6.80 (3 H) and a singlet at δ 3.83 (6 H) in the 1H n.m.r. spectrum were in keeping with the presence of a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group characteristic of the mesembrine class of alkaloids. However,a6H singlet at δ2.25 suggestive of a dimethylamino-function was not compatible with an alkaloid belonging to the mesembrine series. Furthermore,the mass spectrum contained a molecular ion at m/e 303 corresponding to C1gH2zNOg and also,more importantly,exhibited a base peak at m/e 58 andan abundant ion at m/e 72. Thelatterions,which maybe represented by structures (8)and (9),respectively, are characteristic of sceletium alkaloids of the joubertiamine classand originate from cleavage of the dimethylamino-side-chain.4 Spectral data indicated that this new base is 3'-methoxy-4'-O-methyljoubertiamine (6). In conformity with the suggested structure,the new base was identical with the product obtained by treating (一)-mesembrine methiodide with aqueous sodium carbonate. The constitution of this new alkaloid is of interest in that it is the first reported example in the joubertiamine series containinga dioxygenated aromatic ring. Biogenetically,it is reasonable to assume that it is

derived from(-)-mesembrinebyreactionswhich parallel the aforementioned chemical conversion.\* The c.d. spectra of the Hofmann product of (-)-mesembrine and the new base were identical thereby leading to the absolute stereochemistry expressed in structure (6) for the latter. The negative c.d. maximum at 340 nm, attributed to the n-→π\* transition of the enone chromophore,indicates that the conformation of the cyclohexenone ringin (6) hasright-hand chirality.5

Isolation of (-)-mesembrane (2) from the non-polar components ofFraction (I) was accomplished by repeated preparative-layer separations. The iH n.m.r. spectrum of this newbase resembled that of mesembrine,and the high-resolution mass spectrum,in addition to giving the molecular formula as C.HzsNO2，showed an abundant ionatm/e2l9 indicativeofthefactthatthealkaloidwas amember of the dimethoxyphenyl-3a-octahydroindole class.4 Since the small amount of alkaloid available

To assess the best description of these rings their endocyclic torsion angles were analysed in terms of their deviations from ideal half-chair (Cz) and envelope (Cs) symmetry-constrained values and the results (Table5) show that different half-chair forms occur in (1),(4),and (5)，whereas in (3)an envelope form is preferred. An alternative description of these five-membered ring conformations is to express them in terms of a phase angle of pseudorotation,△,and a maximum angle of torsion, ωm, analogous to those accorded to steroid D rings;8 the computed values of these parameters are included in Table 5.In (3),(4),and (5),the N-methyl group and the 3a-aryl substituent are consistently syn-oriented with respect to the octahydroindole skeleton from which we conclude that this probably represents the energetically preferred form for the free bases of (4) and (5) since an anti-orientation would introduce very severe non-bonded interactions between the N-methyl group and the cisfused six-membered ring.

The O(9), O(ll),and C(3a) phenyl ring substituents with displacements of -0.016,0.033,and 0.045A,all lie close to the phenyl ring least-squares plane (root-meansquare deviation 0.0o3 A) and the methoxy-methyl groups are rotated co-operatively about the C(Ph)-O bonds to give orientations where the C(2')-C(3')-O(9)-C(l0) and

C(5')-C(4')-O(11)-C(12) torsion angles are 8.5 and 11.6o, respectively，thereby resulting in C(iO)andC(il)displacements of 0.2l4 and 0.307 A to opposite sides of the phenyl ring plane； similar co-operative rotations of adjacent methoxy-groups have been noted in our other studies. The inequalities of the exocyclic valency angles subtended at the methoxy-groups also conform to the usual pattern where the C(Ph)···O vectors bend towards each other in order to reduce Me···H nonbonded interactions.9

In accord with the phenyl ring conformations found in our previous studies of (1),(3),and (4),the negligibly small C(7a)-C(3a)-C(6')-C(1') torsion angle, -0.6°, indicates that the C(l')-C(6')phenyl ring bond effectively eclipses the C(3a)-C(7a) bond，a conformation which results in approximately equal H(5')···H(4β) and H(l')···H(7β) distances in (5),and any rotation about the C(3a)-C(6')bond will only reduce one or other of these to a less-favourable separation. A Dreiding molecularmodel reveals that suchaconformation hasan extremely unfavourable short H(7a) ···H(l') distance ofca.l.6 A relief from which is gained in (5) through valency-angle deformation at C(6') [l25.1(4)and 118.1- (5)°] and by a small increase of the C(3a)-C(7a) and C(3a)-C(6') bonds over normal values.As already stated, C(3a) lies only 0.045 A from the phenyl ring plane so that out-of-plane bending of the C(3a)-C(6') bond is not a significant factor here.Similar small bond-length extensions and valency-angle deformations,as well as more significant amounts of out-of-plane bending of the

C(3a)-C(6')bond,have been encountered in our other studiesthe resultsofwhich indicatethatthelattertwo modes of deformation are coupled. Thus,in (4),where C(3a)lies only O.o3 A from the phenyl-ring plane,the exocyclic valency angles at C(6') [1i6.8(l3) and 125.2- (12)°]are very similar to those in (5).In contrast to this situationare thelarger C(3a) displacements of O.1l8 and 0.148A in (l) and (3),and their associated more equal valency angles of 120.6(5) and 122.0(5)°in (1)and 119.4(4) and 122.4(4)°in (3).

In the crystal the cation and anion are linked by N-H···Cl hydrogen bonds in which the chlorine atom lies close to the local C axis at N(l) and H(l) ··· Cl is 2.19 A. The water molecules bridge chloride ions related by the 2 screw axis through weak hydrogen bonds,H(WA) ·. Cl 2.37 and H(WB) ··Cl 2.08 A. Other short interionic separations correspond to normal vanderWaals-type interactions.

The occurrence of (-)-mesembrane in nature is somewhat unexpected in view of the biogenetic origin of these alkaloids. All previous examples of alkaloids in the mesembrine series have an oxygen function at C(6) in keeping with the biosynthetic experiments 10 which haveshown that theoctahydroindoleskeletonisderived from the intact incorporation of tyrosine. Presumably the biological course of removal of the C(6) oxygen occurs through the sequence (l0)-→(3)->mesembrene (2) (with 5,6- or 7,8-double bond)-→(2).

The absolute configuration of (-)-mesembrane is in accord with the absolute stereochemistry derived previously for other alkaloids of this family from the X-ray analysis of (4) and by interpretation of the Cotton effect in (-)-mesembrine based upon the octant rule. The chiroptical results and the conformational features deduced by the 1H n.m.r.have provided in conjunction with the X-ray analyses a consistent structural picture in which the full stereochemistry of these alkaloids belongingto asingleantipodal series is correctlyrepresented by structure (lo) for(-)-mesembrine.

The correlation of the absolute configuration of (一)- mesembrine,derived from application of the octant rule, with the X-ray structure determinations of (-)-6- epimesembranol methiodide and (-)-mesembrane hydrochloride is of particular interest with regard to the chiroptical properties of β-aminoketones. Hudec 1l has concluded that β-aminoketones with an axial C-N bond should exhibit antioctant behaviour whereas those with an equatorial C-N bond have been predicted to exhibit octant behaviour. These latter systems possess the required parallel arrangement of the orbitals necessary for o-conjugation 15 may be achieved by the appropriate rotamer of a simple axial β-aminocyclohexanone having the conformation illustrated in structure (ll). Contrary to Hudec's suggestion it would appear that α conjugation in this class of compounds should not be excluded a priori from consideration. In (-)-mesembrine the bicyclic cis-fused ring system, with an axial aryl substituent， placescertain constraints on the geometry around nitrogen and it necessary parallel orientation of the nitrogen lone-pair, the αβ o-bond,and the p orbitals of the carbonyl group, asrequired to permit interaction of the nitrogen lonepair and the carbonyl group through o conjugation. Supporting evidence for such interactions in these latter systemshasbeenprovidedbyavariety of experimental measurements including electronic absorption spectroscopy,12photoelectronspectroscopy,13and circular dichroism.14 In the c.d. studies it was found that removal of the lone-pair-carbonyl interaction by protonation of the equatorial nitrogen substituent resulted in a change of sign of the n->π\* transition of the carbonyl group corresponding to antioctant behaviour.11

Theprevious lack of available chiral axial β-aminoketones has precluded examination of their Cotton effects associated with the n->π\* transition of the carbonyl group in these systems. Before discussing the c.d.spectrum of (-)-mesembrine some further points need to be made regarding o-conjugation of the nitrogen lone-pair and a carbonyl group in β-aminoketones. Inspection ofDreidingmolecular models reveals that the

would appear to be impossible for the nitrogen lone-pair to assume a position collinear with the orbitals of the C(7)-C(7a) o bond. On this basis,it was expected that (-)-mesembrine should exhibit antioctant behaviour. However,when the negative Cotton effect of thisalkaloid is considered in conjunction with the considerable wealth of information on the conformational and configurational properties of this series of alkaloids,2,6,16 normal octant behaviour is clearly established. To test the unlikely event that g-conjugation of the nitrogen lone-pair and the carbonyl group was responsible for the chiroptical properties of (-)-mesembrine，we examined the c.d. spectra of (-)-mesembrine hydrochloride and (-)-mesembrine methiodide； results are shown in Figure 3. Most surprisingly，the spectrum of the hydrochloride shows the absence of the n-→π\* band of a carbonyl group. While the known propensity of β-aminoketones to undergo eliminationunderacidic conditions had led us to consider that this possibilitymight createa complication in the interpretation of the c.d.spectrum,this is ruled 14W.A.Ayer,B.Altenkirk,R.H.Burnell,and M.Moinas, Canad.J.Chem.,1969,47,449.

out by the absence of a maximum in the region of 340 nm, normally associated with the n->π\* transition of an αβ-unsaturated ketone. We feel that the best explanation for the absence of a carbonyl band is provided by postulating that hydration of the carbonyl group has occurred to give the diol (l3).\* Thishydration reaction would appear to be facilitated by intramolecular catalysis through hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl group to the hydrogen atom on the neighbouring ammonium ion in salt (l2). Additional factors which may act as driving forces for the hydration are dipole effects which are known to favour the hydrated form of carbonyl groups which are gauche to ammonium or phosphonium ions in cyclic systems.17

FIGURE 3 Circular dichroism spectra of (a)(-)-mesembrine, (b)(-)-mesembrine hydrochloride，and （C） methiodide derivatives,recorded in dioxan:water (3:1)

Since the c.d. spectrum of the hydrochloride failed to provide the required information，the corresponding spectrum of (-)-mesembrine methiodide was examined. It showed a broad negative maximum at 33o nm,which is not characteristic for a cyclohexenone. From this observation it would appear that the methiodide is in equilibrium with enone (6)，since the c.d.spectrum is consistent with the composite absorptions of two overlapping n-→π\* bands of the two chromophores.

The foregoing results establish that (-)-mesembrine, despite being an axial β-aminoketone,exhibits normal oetant behaviour.

\*Note added in proof:This structure is supported by the 13C n.m.r.spectrum of (-)-mesembrine hydrochloride in DO. The spectrum lacksa signal attributable toa carbonyl carbon; details will be presented in a future paper dealing with the i3C n.m.r.spectraofmesembrinealkaloids.

# EXPERIMENTAL

I.r.spectra were obtained for solutions in CHCl on Perkin-Elmer models 137，237，and 621 spectrometers; u.v.spectra were measured for 95% ethanol solutions on a Beckman DBG spectrophotometer. 1H n.m.r. spectra were recorded at l0o MHz on a JEOL MH1o0 spectrometer, with tetramethylsilane as internal reference in deuteriochloroform unless otherwise noted. Low-resolution mass spectra were determined on a DuPont 21 49o instrument, high-resolution spectra on an A.E.I. MS9o2 spectrometer. G.l.c.was carried out ona Hewlett-Packard 402 with 8 ft X 0.125 in glass columns packed with OV I7 (3%)or SE 30 (3%)on Gas-Chrom Q(1o0-120 mesh).C.d.and o.r.d. spectra were obtained ona JASCO spectropolarimeter.

Extraction of Alkaloids from S.namaquense,L.Bolus.- Dried plant material of S.namaquense L.Bolus (4 kg) was macerated in a Waring blender with 95% ethanol (10 1). The filter cake was continuously extracted (Soxhlet)with 95%ethanol (l5 l)，the combined extracts concentrated (21)and acidified with tartaric acid (5%).The acidic aqueous solution was extracted with diethyl ether (4l) and the ethereal extract discarded. After basification of the aqueous phase with sodium carbonate，the solution was extracted with chloroform (5 l) followed by chloroformmethanol (4:1；1l). The chloroform extract was concentrated (1 l),extracted with lN-sodium hydroxide (l × 400 ml)，and washed with water. Evaporation of solvent yielded non-phenolic alkaloids (l50 g). Phenolic alkaloids (35g) wererecovered from the alkaline solution byadjusting to pH9(with CO) and extracting into chloroform(1 × 500 ml).

Preliminaryunit-cell dimensions and space-group data were obtained from oscillation and Weissenberg photographs (Cu-Kα radiation) and precession photographs (Mo-K radiation,λ= O.7107 A).The crystal was transferred to an Enraf-Nonius CAD 3 automated diffractometer (Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation，3o take-off angle) and more accurate unit-cell dimensions derived by least-squares treatment of the 0,x,andΦ angles for 40 high-orderreflections widely separated in reciprocal space. Intensity data to 0 67were recorded by the 0--20 scanning procedure with scanwidths (l.20 + 0.6otan0); background measurements were taken at each end of the scanrange for half the duration of the scan. Therewas no significant variation in the intensity of a strong reference reflection measured after each batch of 99 reflections. Of 1 752 measured values,1158 reflections with I> 2σ(I) [where g²(I)= scan count + total background count] were corrected forLorentz and polarization effects. Absorption corrections,established from the-dependence of the intensity of the O40 reflection,were also applied to these data.

Structure Analysis.-The structure was solved by direct phase-determining methods using MULTAN18 with the highest 236 E values and allowing the program to select seven reflections for the starting set. An E map computedbyuse of that set of phaseswhich produced the highest figure of merit and lowest residual yielded positions for the chlorine and I5 other non-hydrogen atoms. The remaining non-hydrogen atoms,save the N-methyl carbon atom，were located in two subsequent Fourier syntheses. Refinement of atomic positional and isotropic thermal parameters by full-matrix least-squares calculations reduced R from 0.21 to 0.l4 at which point the position of the final carbon atom was established froma difference-Fourier synthesis. Continuation of the least-squares refinement decreased R to 0.09o. When anomalous scattering corrections for chlorine were introduced into the structure-factor calculations R for the co-ordinates corresponding to the absolute configuration depicted by (5) was 0.089 3 whereas for the mirror image it was O.094 2. This highly significant 19 difference indicates that (5) correctly represents the absolute stereochemistry.Hydrogen atoms were then located in a difference-Fourier synthesis,and their positional parameters were included as variables in subsequent least-squares iterations which convergedatR O.o55. A parallel refinement on the enantiomer of (5) converged at R 0.059，a result which supported the earlier conclusion that (5) correctly represents the absolute stereochemistry. Final atomicpositionalparametersarein Tables1and2. Anisotropic temperature factors for the non-hydrogen atomsare includedwitha Tableofobservedandcalculated structure amplitudes in Supplementary Publication No.SUP 21984 (9 pp.,1 microfiche).\*

Forall structure-factorcalculations,scatteringfactors for chlorine，carbon，nitrogen，and oxygen were taken from ref.20andforhydrogen fromref.21；that for chlorinewas corrected for the effects of anomalous dispersion.2 In the least-squares calculations the function minimized was ∑w△²，with weights w being assigned according to the scheme √w=1 for Fl≤7.5 and √w= 7.5/|Fl for F> 7.5. During the least-squares iterations the y coordinate of the chlorine atom was held constant to define the space-group origin.
