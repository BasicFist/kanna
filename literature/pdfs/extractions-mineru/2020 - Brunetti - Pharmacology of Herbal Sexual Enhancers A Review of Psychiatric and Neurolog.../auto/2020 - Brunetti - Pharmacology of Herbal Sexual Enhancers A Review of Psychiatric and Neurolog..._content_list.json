        "text": "Abstract: Sexual enhancers increase sexual potency, sexual pleasure, or libido. Substances increasing libido alter the concentrations of specific neurotransmitters or sex hormones in the central nervous system. Interestingly, the same pathways are involved in the mechanisms underlying many psychiatric and neurological disorders, and adverse reactions associated with the use of aphrodisiacs are strongly expected. However, sexual enhancers of plant origin have gained popularity over recent years, as natural substances are often regarded as a safer alternative to modern medications and are easily acquired without prescription. We reviewed the psychiatric and neurological adverse effects associated with the consumption of herbal aphrodisiacs Areca catechu L., Argemone Mexicana L., Citrus aurantium L., Eurycoma longifolia Jack., Lepidium meyenii Walp., Mitragyna speciosa Korth., Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, Panax quinquefolius L., Pausinystalia johimbe (K. Schum.) Pierre ex Beille, Piper methysticum G. Forst., Ptychopetalum olacoides Benth., Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N. E. Brown, Turnera diffusa Willd. ex. Schult., Voacanga africana Stapf ex Scott-Elliot, and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal. A literature search was conducted on the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with the aim of identifying all the relevant articles published on the issue up to June 2020. Most of the selected sexual enhancers appeared to be safe at therapeutic doses, although mild to severe adverse effects may occur in cases of overdosing or self-medication with unstandardized products. Drug interactions are more concerning, considering that herbal aphrodisiacs are likely used together with other plant extracts and/or pharmaceuticals. However, few data are available on the side effects of several plants included in this review, and more clinical studies with controlled administrations should be conducted to address this issue. ",

        "text": "Sexual drive is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors, but it can also be affected by medications and medical conditions. Many prescription drugs and narcotics (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, adrenergic receptor blockers, antipsychotics, and opioids) can negatively impact sexual desire, inhibit erection, ejaculation, or orgasm, and so on. Contrariwise, many aphrodisiac substances can improve sexual performance. In particular, substances of natural origin have been used worldwide for millennia in traditional medicines to boost sexual desire, sexual pleasure, or sexual behavior [1], and the use of psychoactive and/or stimulant drugs during intercourse, i.e., chemsex, is on the rise [2]. Nowadays, sexual performance anxiety, which contributes to psychogenic erectile dysfunction, is estimated to affect 9 to 25% of men in the United States, and phytotherapy is often employed as a treatment [3]. In 2007, approximately 56% of infertile couples had sought medical care worldwide [4] and many of these couples had opted for supportive complementary and alternative medicines to treat infertility. In 2010, in the United States, approximately 29% of 428 infertile couples had utilized an alternative treatment after 18 months of observation, 59% of which had taken herbal therapy [5]. Natural substances are mistakenly believed to be a safer alternative to modern medications with no side effects. They are also readily accessible on the Internet and specialized markets without a prescription. Consequently, the use of herbal supplements to enhance sexual drive has become increasingly popular, and more than 300,000 intoxications were reported to poison control centers over the last 20 years [6,7].

        "text": "According to Sandroni, aphrodisiacs can be classified into three categories according to whether they increase potency (i.e., effectiveness of erection in males), sexual pleasure, or libido (i.e., sexual desire) [8]. Potency-enhancing substances typically induce vasodilation, often through the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, inducing hypotension and potentially harmful cardiovascular effects (e.g., sildenafil and L-arginine). Sexual pleasure-enhancing substances cause tumescence and lubrication of the genital mucosa, therefore increasing sensation (e.g., cantharidin). Libido-enhancing substances alter the concentrations of specific neurotransmitters (e.g., dopaminergic and serotoninergic pathways) or sex hormones (e.g., pituitary hormones and testosterone) in the central nervous system (CNS) [8]. For example, methamphetamine is a synthetic illicit psychomotor stimulant affecting the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which plays an essential role in motivation and the reward system. A substantial body of evidence shows that acute methamphetamine use is associated with enhanced positive sexual experiences and libido, with a greater likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors. Sexual behavior, however, may be impaired due to chronic methamphetamine exposure [9]. ",

        "text": "The modulation of neurotransmission is also involved in the mechanisms underlying many psychiatric and neurological disorders. For instance, although not fully understood, the dysregulation of monoaminergic systems, especially the decrease in serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and adrenergic neurotransmissions, seems to be the primary cause of depression [10]. Contrariwise, mania is believed to be the consequence of an excess of the same monoamines in specific regions of the brain [11]. Schizophrenia, however, mainly involves dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions [12]. In neurology, a deficit of dopamine due to the death of cells in the substantia nigra is the primary cause of Parkinson’s disease, while Alzheimer’s disease is due to the degeneration of the hippocampus and the raphe nuclei, affecting the cholinergic pathway [13]. The drugs approved to treat psychiatric and neurological conditions mainly target these neurotransmission pathways. ",

        "text": "Considering the mechanism of action of sexual enhancers, psychiatric and neurological adverse effects associated with their consumption are strongly expected. In 2014, Corazza et al. reviewed the psychoactive effects of four popular sexual enhancers [6]. In March 2020, Srivatsav et al. reviewed the efficacy and the safety profile of several common aphrodisiacs used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, but the study was not exhaustive and psychiatric and neurological adverse effects were not addressed [14]. In this review, we aimed to summarize and interpret the findings of cases and preclinical and clinical studies reporting psychiatric and neurological adverse effects associated with the use of aphrodisiacs of plant origin. A preliminary screening of the literature allowed for the identification of several plants with potential psychiatric or neurological complications, which were therefore included in this review: Areca catechu L., Argemone Mexicana L., Citrus aurantium L., Eurycoma longifolia Jack., Lepidium meyenii Walp., Mitragyna speciosa Korth., Panax ginseng C.

The fruit, obtained from the palm tree, Areca catechu L., is commonly chewed in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific islands [155,156] for its antiparasitic, digestive, euphoric, and aphrodisiac effects [157,158]. There are two main ways to prepare areca nut for chewing: wrapping a split unripe nut with lime paste (calcium oxide) in a betel tree leaf or inserting a piece of Piper betel L. inflorescence with lime paste into an unripe areca nut [22,154,159].

        "text": "The betel nut contains a variety of active alkaloids responsible for its effects. The content of major alkaloids arecoline, arecaidine, guvacoline, and guvacine in the fresh nut is approximately 0.30–0.63%, 0.31–0.66%, 0.03–0.06%, and 0.19–0.72%, respectively, although it may vary with maturation [160–163]. Due to the presence of calcium oxide, arecoline and guvacoline are hydrolyzed to arecaidine and guvacine, respectively, in basic conditions [163,164]. Areca alkaloids mediate the autonomic responses of the parasympathetic nervous system and the synaptic transmission in the peripheral nervous system [164–166], and impact various aspects of brain function and regulation [167,168]. Arecoline is a partial muscarinic (M) agonist and possesses a higher affinity for M receptors than guvacoline [24,169]. High arecoline doses produce nicotinic cholinergic effects [170]. As tertiary amines, arecoline and, to a lesser extent, arecaidine have a deep brain penetration [165,169]. It was demonstrated that arecoline enhances cognition and memory and significantly improves several behavioral disorders in patients with Alzheimer’s disease or schizophrenia, through the activation of postsynaptic M1 receptors [24,162,171]. In addition, improvements in positive and negative symptoms of psychosis have been observed in schizophrenic areca nut chewers [155,172,173]. It is believed that arecoline reduces the dopaminergic hyperactivity underlying the positive symptoms of psychosis throughout the modulation of M1, M2, and M4 receptors, and induces dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, the striatum, and the ventral tegmental area, ameliorating the negative symptoms [169,174,175]. Furthermore, the release of dopamine and other catecholamines causes stimulant and libido-enhancing effects [3,156,166,176,177]. These effects, coupled with the inhibition of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) caused by aromatic phenolic compounds of the plant, may also explain the antidepressant properties of the areca nut [24,169].

Furthermore, if betel nut is taken in high quantities, transient extrapyramidal symptoms including rigidity, bradykinesia, and jaw tremor may occur [24,176,180]. These effects are probably due to guvacine and arecaidine, which are strong inhibitors of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake and contribute to the reduction in spontaneous activity and body excitability [181–183]. However, it was also demonstrated that areca alkaloids reduce GABA affinity for the GABAA receptor, and arecaidine and guvacine effects on GABA signaling may cause epileptic seizures [23,169,180,184]. The main risks associated with the chronic consumption of betel nut are related to its metabolism. Indeed, areca alkaloids are converted into DNA alkylating nitrosamines, which cause cell proliferation and oxidative stress-dependent neurotoxicity, leading to oral carcinogenicity and exacerbating neurodegenerative disease symptoms [24,158,183,185]. Albeit its use is culturally well accepted, the betel nut is a strongly addictive substance and multiple adverse effects were reported (Table 1). Tolerance and nicotine/amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome, characterized by insomnia, mood swings, irritability, and anxiety, may appear after repeated intakes [16,167,179]. ",

The most abundant flavonoids are hesperetin and naringenin, which possess, together with terpenoids, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid, a free radical-scavenging ability and inhibit proinflammatory mediators release, exerting a powerful antioxidant activity and reducing tumoral cell proliferation [191,192]. Terpenoids such as d-limonene, α-pinene, β-myrcene, linalyl acetate, and linalool are the main volatile components of the plant [193,194], and are distilled or extracted from blooms, leaves, and orange peel to obtain essential oils (EOs) [195]. These substances, especially d-limonene, modify the cell membrane of microbes and denature enzymes responsible for their germination and sporulation, showing antimicrobic and antifungal properties [191,196]. For these reasons, bitter orange tree’s EOs are widely sold as flavoring and preservative agents in foods and drinks [190,197]. Recently, a great interest in these EOs has been observed in the context of alternative medicines such as aromatherapy. It was demonstrated that these substances, after vaporization and inhalation, are effective for treating different forms of anxiety, sleep, and libido, and reduce seizures in animal models [38,39,198–201]. The mechanism of action of the plant’s ingredients, however, is not fully elucidated. Anxiolytic and hypnotic effects are seemingly due to the combination of the action of the plant’s aroma on the limbic system through olfaction and the direct action of terpenes on GABAergic and serotoninergic (5-HT1A) receptors [39,202,203].

Mitragyna leaves are traditionally chewed, smoked, or boiled with hot water and served as a tea [208].

        "text": "More than 40 alkaloids were isolated from kratom. The alkaloids’ content is variable and depends on plant age, season, and geographical location [211]. Mitragynine is the most abundant active compound and accounts for up to 66% of the total mass of crude alkaloids extract. Other major alkaloids are paynantheine, which is the second most abundant alkaloid (10% of total content), speciogynine, and speciociliatine. Among the various minor alkaloids, 7-hydroxymitragynine is of particular interest due to its important role in mediating the analgesic effect of mitragynine [157]. Both mitragynine and its oxidized metabolite 7-hydroxymitragynine are partial agonists of µ-opioid receptors (MOR) and competitive antagonists of κ- and δ-opioid receptors (KOR and DOR), which are involved in analgesia. However, mitragynine affinity for opioid receptors is lower than that of morphine, while 7-hydroxymitragynine affinity is approximately 46 and 13 times higher than that of mitragynine and morphine, respectively [212]. The possible stimulant and libido-enhancing effects of mitragynine may be due to the blockade of serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors and the postsynaptic stimulation of α2 adrenergic receptors (α2R) in the CNS [212]. Recently, LaBryer et al. hypothesized that kratom may have restored testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin levels in a patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [213]. Mitragynine also binds adenosine A2A receptors, dopamine D2 receptors, and serotonin receptors 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, but the physiological significance of these interactions is unclear [214]. Data showed that low kratom doses (1–5 g) induce stimulating effects, involving the release of neurotransmitters by reversible blockade of calcium channels. At higher doses (>15 g), it can cause sedative/narcotic effects, and the plant can be used as a general analgesic, as an opium substitute, or to treat opium withdrawal symptoms [215]. ",

Over twelve ginseng species were identified, although mainly Asian or Korean ginseng (P. ginseng) and American ginseng (P. quinquefolius) have been used for their therapeutic properties. Asian ginseng grows in East Asian mountains, while American ginseng is an endangered species that grows in deciduous forests of the west half of North America. Asian ginseng is an emblematic plant of traditional Chinese medicine, and is listed in the Shennong Ben Cao Jing, the most ancient Chinese book of herbal medications. A variety of pharmacological effects are attributed to ginseng. For example, it is used to improve intelligence, to treat impotence, to treat hemorrhage, to relax, and to slow aging [218]. American ginseng medical use is more recent and has gained popularity in Western countries over recent decades. Ginseng health benefits were demonstrated in many clinical studies in various fields: it has shown aphrodisiac, anti-inflammatory, anticancer (lung, liver, intestine, and stomach), antidiabetic, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, antiamnestic, and antioxidative (heart and kidney) properties [219]. The fresh root of ginseng can be directly chewed after peeling or soaked in wine for drinking and chewing. In China and Korea, it is boiled with chicken to prepare energy drinks, teas, and candies [218]. ",

Ginsenosides are classified into two groups depending on the hydroxylation of their steroid core structure: the 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) groups. Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, and Rd are the main PPD-type ginsenosides, and Rg1 and Re are the main PPT-type ginsenosides. A total of 32 ginsenosides, including the abovementioned compounds, are found in in both American and Asian ginseng, but the two plants also possess specific ginsenosides. The presence of Rf, a PPD/PPT ratio lower than 2, and a Rb1/Rg1 ratio lower than 5 usually identify Asian ginseng. The content of ginsenosides is affected by seasons, geographical distribution, and processing (fresh ginseng, steamed ginseng or white ginseng, and sun-dried ginseng or red ginseng) [220]. After oral administration, ginsenosides are mainly metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, undergoing successive deglycosylations: Rg3 is a metabolite of Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, and Rd, and is further metabolized to Rh2; Rg2 is a metabolite of Re; and Rh1 is a metabolite of both Rg1 and Rg2. Ginsenosides have low oral bioavailability, owing to their low membrane permeability and their degradation in the gastrointestinal tract [219]. Rg1 induces NO synthesis in endothelial cells and perivascular nerves, and increases vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO, prolonging the erection in males and enhancing sexual potency. In addition, P. ginseng was proved to increase testosterone, ",

Mancuso and Santangelo recently reviewed the effects of ginsenosides on the immune system (e.g., modulation of the immune response, anti-inflammatory effects), the nervous system (e.g., regulation of the stress axis, improvement of memory and learning functions), and the cardiovascular system (e.g., improvement of cardiac performance, cardioprotective effects) [222].

A few cases of headache following ginseng administration were reported without placebo control [84,91]. Insomnia, agitation, and fatigue were more frequent [82–84,89,94], but still uncommon. More interestingly, several cases of manic-like effects, such as confusion, agitation, irritation, nervousness, anxiety, and bizarre behavior, without history of psychiatric disorder, were reported following ginseng use [77,78,81,85,87,88,90,228]. These cases, however, were isolated and generally resulted from high ginseng doses or with the concomitant use of other substances (e.g., phenelzine, cannabis, herbal supplements); mania was not reported in clinical studies using ginseng alone or in combination. In fact, ginseng toxicity mainly comes from drug interactions with cytochromes P450 (CYPs) CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and serotoninergic drugs, intensifying sedative effects or inducing cognitive disorders or a serotonin syndrome [229–231].

Yohimbine is marketed as a pharmaceutical prescribed for the treatment of erectile impotence and has been used in multiple clinical trials as a probe to identify abnormal physiological and affective responses to increased noradrenergic signaling, especially in patients with panic disorders [235,236]. Yohimbine is a potent selective α2R antagonist with weaker α1R antagonist activity that blocks the presynaptic feedback inhibition of noradrenaline release, prolonging the excitatory effects of noradrenaline at postsynaptic α1R and β-receptors [237,238]. Yohimbine has a relatively short half-life due to an extensive hepatic metabolism, which produces two main hydroxylated metabolites, 11- and 10-hydroxyyohimbine, that are rapidly excreted in urine [239,240]. There is increasing interest in botanic dietary supplements containing yohimbine extracts in the context of sexual and body enhancement [241]. ",

Due to these potential cardiac and neurological adverse effects, yohimbine was used in patients with difficulties to reach orgasm, with erectile dysfunction, or with low libido, mainly before the emergence of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil), which present a better safety profile [243,244]. The yohimbine mechanism of action is currently unclear. There is evidence suggesting that yohimbine increases libido by blocking α2R in the locus coeruleus, which is involved in the control of the erection. Peripherally, it was suggested that yohimbine enhances NO release from cavernosal endothelial cells, producing a relaxation of smooth muscle cells and consequent erection, increasing sexual potency [3,6,237]. Moderate to severe adverse effects like sweating, flushing, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, bronchospasm, chest pain, and atrial fibrillation are reported after deliberate or accidental ingestion, while lethal intoxications are extremely rare [245,246].

Kava also contains a variety of other non-lactone compounds, i.e., flavokawains A, B, and C, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone, cinnamic acid bornyl ester, flavanones, fatty acids, and a chalcone. Kava effects may be the result of a synergy of the six major kavalactones [249]. Kava extracts produce a similar activity profile as that of benzodiazepines, which interact with GABA receptors, inhibit the MAO-B, and inhibit dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake in the CNS, inducing libido-enhancing properties [250]. In vitro studies of the hippocampus and other brain regions suggest that the sedative effects of kavalactones may be mediated by an increase in GABAA receptor binding sites [251,252]. It was demonstrated that several kavalactones are potent inhibitors of several CYP metabolic enzymes [253]. Oral pharmacokinetics of kawain (100 mg/kg) were determined in rats with and without co-administration of kava extract (256 mg/kg).

Other compounds detected in muirapuama are fatty acid esters of sterols, coumarin, free fatty acids, and free sterol; a small quantity of β-sitosterol was also detected [262]. Based on ethnopharmacological data, it can be hypothesized that muirapuama interacts with the dopaminergic system, increasing libido; the noradrenergic system, inducing antidepressant effects; and the serotonergic system, modulating appetite. The antinociceptive effects of the plant were investigated in thermal and chemical models of nociception in mice. Data showed that the maximal effect was reached 6 h after administration of a low dose of muirapuama extract and produces significant and long-lasting (up 12 h) effects in both chemical and thermal tests of nociception in mice. In addition, higher doses, either acutely or subchronically (15 days), did not cause a worsening of adverse effects [263].

In fact, the plant is widely sold over the Internet and specialized herbal shops to increase sexual performance, although its mechanism of action and effects were not clearly demonstrated. This dual inhibitory effect has been studied for the development of compounds for the treatment of cognition impairment, motor dysfunction, depression, and neurodegeneration [270]. Mesembrenone is the most potent inhibitor of PDE4A, while mesembrine is more selective towards the serotonin receptor. In addition, mesembrine is also an agonist of GABAA, δ2-opioid, µ-opioid, cholecystokinin-1, E4-prostaglandin, and melatonin-1 receptors at high doses, and shows antinociceptive effects in animal models [266,270–273].
