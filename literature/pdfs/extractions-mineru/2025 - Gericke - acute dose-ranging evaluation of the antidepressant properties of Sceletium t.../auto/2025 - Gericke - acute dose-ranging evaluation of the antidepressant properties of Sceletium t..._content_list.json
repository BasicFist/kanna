Due to their selective actions to bolster monoamine levels, currently prescribed antidepressants appear insufficient to engender full and sustained remission of the illness (Akil et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2018).

Additionally, these preparations may exhibit multi-target mechanisms of action on many different neurobiological processes implicated in MDD (Fajemiroye et al., 2016; Sarris, 2018). While most of these natural substances show potential as monotherapy, others indicate more favourable results when combined with traditional antidepressants (Akhondzadeh et al., 2003). Consequently, the World Health Organization initiated a traditional medicine strategy for 2014–2023 stating that evidence-based research be utilized to evaluate the safety and efficacy of complementary medicines (World Health Organization, 2013). Furthermore, in resource constricted countries, up to $8 0 \\%$ of the population depends on herbal medicines for primary healthcare, albeit with a lack of supporting scientific data (Oyebode et al., 2016). A significant deterrent in studying herbal preparations is the lack of standardization, which leads to inconsistency in results (Sarris et al., 2021). It is with this motivation that a standardized extract of the indigenous South African plant, Sceletium tortuosum (ST), has attracted a great deal of interest (Olatunji et al., 2021; Brendler et al., 2021).

The characteristic alkaloid profile of Sceletium tortuosum, including mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol, and mesembranol (Krstenansky, 2017), presents with subtly different neuro-psycho-pharmacological actions (Olatunji et al., 2021) that may underlie the above-mentioned therapeutic properties. These actions include up-regulating vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2), serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibition, inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) activity, anti-inflammatory properties, inhibition of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and inhibition of the noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) transporters (NAT, DAT) (Olatunji et al., 2021). Clinically, ST also shows a relatively low side effect profile (Krstenansky, 2017; Murbach et al., 2014) although elevated blood pressure, headache, nausea, irritability, insomnia and anxiety are associated with its use (Schifano et al., 2015), while some studies suggest further investigation into possible dose-dependent adverse effects (Smith, 2011; Loria et al., 2014). Clearly, further exploration of the potential antidepressant actions of ST could prove invaluable due to its multi-modal mechanisms of action that align well with the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD (Brand et al., 2015).

All experiments were approved by the NWU-AnimCareREC animal research ethics committee (NHREC reg. number AREC-130913-015) of the North-West University, and all steps of animal handling conformed to the South African National Standard (SANS) for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (SANS 10386:2008). Animals were maintained and procedures performed in accordance with the code of ethics in research, training, and testing of drugs in South Africa and complied with national legislation (ethics approval number NWU-00168-18-A5). Importantly, these studies were performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines (McGrath et al., 2010). ",

A previously published method by Brand and Harvey (2017) was implemented. Following a 5 min habituation period in the test room, rats were placed in a Perspex $^ \\mathrm { \\textregistered }$ cylinder (diameter $1 8 \\mathrm { c m } ,$ , height $6 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ ) containing $3 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ of ${ 2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } }$ water and allowed to swim for a total of $7 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ . A water depth of $3 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ was necessary to prevent rats from touching the bottom of the cylinder. Side-view video footage was recorded, with the first and last minutes excluded from scoring, as described previously (Oberholzer et al., 2018). Randomly assigned video codes were used to ensure unbiased scoring. Immobility (floating) was defined as the necessary movements to keep the rat’s head above the water. Swimming (horizontal movement across quadrants) and climbing/struggling (upward movement against the side of the cylinder) behaviours inform on possible serotonergic and noradrenergic-mediated activity, respectively (Cryan et al., 2005). Thereafter, the rats were removed from the cylinders, gently dried with a clean towel and returned to their home cage (Brand and Harvey, 2017; Oberholzer et al., 2018). Since FSL rats display pronounced hang-time upon first being introduced to the FST (Du Jardin et al., 2018; Overstreet et al., 2005), the animals were not subjected to a pre-swim, as is customary in the FST (Cryan et al., 2002; Slattery and Cryan, 2012).

An ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post-hoc analysis (for normally distributed data), or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn’ multiple comparisons (for non-normal distributed data), was used to analyse behaviour between treated and untreated FSL animals, as previously described (Harvey et al., 2021; Liebenberg et al., 2015; Uys et al., 2017).

Indeed, decreased locomotor activity is said to underlie decreased reactive coping in a novel environment (immobility and passivity) (Magara et al., 2015a,b; Overstreet, 1993; Overstreet et al., 2005).

ESC shows dose-dependent antidepressant-like effects in the FST after acute oral treatment (Fig. 2) and confirms the predictive validity of the FSL model which also corresponds with previous studies (Bech et al., 2006; Loria et al., 2014; Murdoch and Keam, 2005; Schell, 2014). These data also confirm the FSL model to be a valid preparation with which to test the antidepressant properties of Zembrin®. ESC 5 proved the more effective antidepressant dose by significantly decreasing immobility in the FST (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, ESC 5 failed to significantly increase swimming behaviour, a noted serotonergic response (Fig. 2B), although this was significantly increased following a higher dose, viz. ESC 10 (Fig. 2B), thus reaffirming its serotonergic enhancing actions. In fact, ESC failed to significantly increase climbing behaviour, a noradrenergic response (Fig. 2C), versus control animals, in keeping with an SSRI (Cryan et al., 2005). The ability of all doses of ESC to increase locomotor activity (Fig. 2D) may be related to an increase in swimming behaviour and hence a possible serotonergic action (Kitamura et al., 2016). That said, increased locomotor activity may imply a false positive response in the FST (De Kloet et al., 1999; Slattery and Cryan, 2012), although this would have entailed a general increase in swimming and struggling and reduced immobility across all doses, which did not happen. Moreover, despite a sustained increase in locomotor acitivty at all doses of ESC, no accompanying reversal of immobility was observed with ESC 10 or ESC 20 (Fig. 2B). While many studies suggest $1 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g / k g }$ to be a nominal therapeutic dose for ESC via oral gavage (Hui et al., 2010, 2016), ESC 20 and ESC 10 presented with similar, albeit less robust responses across all FST parameters (Fig. 2). These observations probably reflect over-activation of pre-synaptic $5 { \\mathrm { - H T } } _ { 1 \\mathrm { A } }$ auto-receptors thus lowering 5-HT levels with reduced antidepressant-like response as a consequence (Blier and Ward, 2003; Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017). Based on these data, ESC 5 was selected as the reference antidepressant for the Zembrin $^ \\mathrm { \\textregistered }$ comparative study. ",

(2012) suggest that ST shares some mechanistic properties of SSRIs as both target 5-HT through potent inhibition of SERT (Harvey et al., 2011; Brendler et al., 2021). In fact, alkaloid components of ST, specifically mesembrine, mesembrenol and mesembrenone, present with dose-dependent inhibitory actions on SERT, similar to that of citalopram and fluoxetine (Coetzee et al., 2016; Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Krstenansky, 2017). ST also possesses monoamine releasing properties by increasing VMAT-2 and is also a mild MAO-A inhibitor (Coetzee et al., 2016; Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Krstenansky, 2017). Although not immediately evident with respect to the actions of Zembrin $^ \\mathrm { \\textregistered }$ on serotonergic-based swimming behaviour (Fig. 3B), ESC and Zembrin $^ \\mathrm { \\textregistered }$ can broadly be regarded as serotonergic drugs, indirectly activating pre-and post-synaptic $5 { \\mathrm { - H T } } _ { 1 \\mathrm { A } }$ and ${ 5 { \\mathrm { - H T } } _ { \\mathrm { 2 A / C } } }$ receptors via SERT inhibition. Moreover, the most effective dose of ESC, viz. $5 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ , also did not increase swimming yet did so at a $1 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g / k g }$ dose, while ESC 5 still significantly reversed immobility in FSL rats (Fig. 2B).

On the other hand, Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { ~ \\textregistered ~ } }$ did not alter locomotor activity at any dose in relation to saline controls (Fig. 3D), thus confirming more specific antidepressant-like actions.

This is especially true with regard to attenuating immobility in the FST (Figs. 2 and 3), with both compounds showing therapeutic equivalence with regard to reversing immobility (Fig. 4A) and coping deficits (struggling) (Fig. 4C). That said, ZEM 50 $( d = 1 . 8 )$ ) induced a slightly greater effect size reduction on immobility than ESC 5 $( d = 1 . 6 )$ . Although speculative, this improved therapeutic benefit may reflect additional target engagement presented by Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { \\textregistered } }$ , viz. actions on phosphodiesterase 4, SERT, NAT and immune–inflammatory processes that simultaneously address multiple deficits in central brain monoamines, neuroinflammation, impaired neuroplasticity and others (Olatunji et al., 2021).

These preliminary findings prompt interest in the therapeutic potential of Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { \\textregistered } }$ in the treatment of MDD. However, further studies need to consider chronic treatment paradigms (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017), evaluate concomitant effects on appropriate biomarkers of MDD, e.g. monoamines, neurotrophins, immune-inflammatory components etc (Brand et al., 2015), study additional behavioural parameters akin to MDD, e.g. anxiety, anhedonia, cognition, and investigate its possible synergistic actions when combined with traditional treatments (Dodd et al., 2005; Sarris, 2018). Albeit preliminary, this is the first investigation of Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { ~ \\textregistered ~ } }$ versus an SSRI in a genetic rodent model of MDD that provides an evidence-based ethnopharmacological basis for the traditional and modern day use of Sceletium tortuosum in the treatment of mood disorders.
