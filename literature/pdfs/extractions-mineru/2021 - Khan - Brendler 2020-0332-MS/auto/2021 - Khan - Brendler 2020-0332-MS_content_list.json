        "text": "Abstract: Modern-day regulatory systems governing conditions for how health products enter national markets constitute a barrier of access for traditional herbal medicines on an international level. Regulatory intentions are focused on ensuring that consumers are being provided with safe, efficacious and high-quality products that, however, collaterally limit opportunities for traditional herbal medicinal products, especially those that do not already have a long-standing tradition of use established in the respective national marketplaces. This case study investigates and compares how a Southern African herbal medicine with great potential as an anxiolytic and mild antidepressant - Mesembryanthemum tortuosum L. [syn. Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E.Br.] aerial parts - fares internationally in today’s regulatory environments. It is argued that inadvertent regulatory favoritism combined with the lack of means for adequate protection of intellectual property may obstruct innovation by creating an almost insurmountable economical hurdle for successful product development and introduction of botanicals from developing countries into most of the world’s health product markets.

It has likely been used by hunter-gatherers and pastoralists from prehistoric times. An early illustration of a sceletium plant can be found in the journal of Cape of Good Hope Governor van der Stel’s expedition to Namaqualand in 1685 [11] who stated that the product, on account of its “agreeable, hearty taste”, has considerable potential as a commercial product. There are two surviving copies of the painting, both show a typical sceletium flower and the characteristic skeletonized leaves which is reflected in the genus name Sceletium, accompanied by the following information, translated from the original Dutch: “This plant is found with the Namaquas and then only on some of their mountains. It is gathered in October and is called Canna. It is held by them and surrounding tribes in as great esteem as the betel or areca with the Indians.” In 1738, Kolben noted kanna (or channa) to be the “greatest Chearer of the Spirits, and the noblest Restorative in the World” [12]. In 1924, Kolben was referencing a plant used by the Khoi for enjoyment, which they “chewed, kept in their mouth for some time, thus becoming excited…” [1]. The traditional use as masticatory is also described by Commelin in 1692 [13], Thunberg ca. 1770 [4], and numerous other sources [1, 6, 12, 14-23]. ",

The Khoikhoi, who know it as Kauwgoed, are in the habit of chewing it and become intoxicated, while the farmers use it in the form of a decoction or tincture, as a good sedative” [6]. Meiring reported common use for its soporific effect on young children, relaxing them when suffering from “acidity”. A few drops of fresh leaf juice were given to a child who would consequently rest quietly for a few hours [24]. Hartwich [15] and Zwicky [23] concluded that the indigenous population clearly used the plant more for recreational purposes than as medicine. The earliest mention of the product being used in tinctures and infusions dates from Pappe (1857). Jacobsen [16] specifically states that sceletium is used as tea, as do Van Wyk [21] and Smith et al. [12]. Sceletium as a sedative is used as a tea (infusion or decoction) or tincture. Indigenous healers in Namaqualand use it to treat alcohol abuse, lending to it being called 'onse droë drank' (our dry liquor). No withdrawal symptoms are recorded for chronic use [25]. Mesembryanthemum tortuosum was once a commodity in the Cape, stores in Namaqualand stocked it until the 1990s. To this day, minute quantities added to breast milk are given to infants for colic [4, 12, 19-22, 26]. ",

It is then spread out on a flat rock to dry in the sun, resulting in the traditional fermented kanna, which is light brown fibrous clumps [25]. In some cases, the fresh foliage or whole plant is simply crushed and placed in the sun to dry, or the fresh plant material is baked in the hot sand under fire [1].

Commercial extracts of M. tortuosum for the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries need to demonstrate batch-to-batch consistency for both alkaloid content and relative composition.

The investigation aimed at characterizing the activities of the two doses of extract in comparison to placebo in terms of brain electrical activity during cognitive as well as emotional challenges. A combination of EEG and eye tracking was used, which allows for analysis of EEG spectral changes over very short time epochs of 364 ms duration. In the presence of the sceletium extract, spectral EEG analysis revealed statistically significant increases of delta (p < 0.01 during the cognitive challenge of arithmetic calculation and during watching a monotonous animal video, an emotional and attentional challenge) and theta spectral power (p < 0.10) during these same challenges) within the frontal brain. This indicates a positive effect of the extract on the electrical activity of the brain during cognitive processing. Further, alpha1 and alpha2 spectral power in the frontal brain was increased during challenges. Such increases of spectral alpha1 power may be interpreted as a greater degree of calmness while increases in alpha2 waves have been related to memory. Beta2 waves increased during mental performance in the presence of the 50 mg dosage of the extract, but not in the 25 mg dose, in parietal, occipital and temporal brain regions. It was concluded that in comparison to placebo, the sceletium extract induced frequency changes in the brain, which have been related to enhanced attention and memory. These results may represent a positive action of Zembrin® on cognitive and emotional processes in the brain [44]. ",

Regulatory barriers as well as regulatory “loopholes” form a highly heterogeneous landscape of opportunity, ranging from relatively open to almost entirely closed systems.

In addition to traditional European herbal medicine practice, some of the most important “alternative” systems of medicine emerged from Europe, such as homeopathy, and anthroposophy. This long and extensive tradition has resulted in an equally pronounced focus on safety and efficacy of herbal products. A resulting array of increasingly complex rules and regulations has developed in European countries over the last century concerning the manufacture and dissemination of herbal medicines, cosmetics and food products. The creation and expansion of the European Union brought with it substantial challenges to harmonization of regulations concerning medicines, food and cosmetic products, as many member states to this day prefer to consider health and safety of their citizens a national concern and not one to be surrendered to a central EU administration. Regulations discussed in the following oftentimes have been subject to acrimonious struggles between desiring and needing harmonization within the EU and defending and retaining national authority concerning health and safety. As all centralized EU legislation needs to be ratified by its members, both the speed by which member states adopt regulations and their interpretation in a national context vary widely. As a result, regulatory approval can be faster and easier in some member states than others [59]. ",

In the food (and food supplement) category, it would be considered ‘novel’, however, despite it being regulated as a food in its country of origin, competent authorities may likely not consider it suitable due to its predominant history as a traditional herbal medicine. At the same time, as it has not been present in the EU marketplace for at least 15 years, and likely also may not be considered suitable for OTC products, it fails to qualify as a THMP. It has no flavour, fragrance or cosmetic uses. This only leaves one category for legal market access, through MA. Drug development, in turn, requires substantial investments and bears substantial risks to such investments. The amount of research already conducted and in the public domain gives little “appetite” to market forces that would have the ability to stem such investment as there is next to no opportunity to protect product development from competition and ensure profitability. Thus, the ingredient becomes a “hot potato”, while interesting, unique and potentially beneficial in a therapeutic setting, nobody reasonably can or wants to “touch it”.
