Insisting that “human rights acquire significance situationally”(32),Englund invites scholars to investigate the social and historical contexts in which rights discourses take concrete form. Relatedly, Anna Tsing (2005） shows how rights discourses,as“engaged universals,”mobilize and invite both powerful and marginalized actors to appropriate them,often with conjunctural effects. Both Englund and Tsing note that such effects include depoliticization,as the ostensible universalism of rights may occlude the actual grounded dynamics of power (see also Badiou 200l；W. Brown 2006;Povinelli 2002).The case of Pelargonium illustrates how the translation of ABS rights to a former homeland depoliticizes the construction of rural residents as customary subjects. Specifically, in an effort to produce communities amenable to biodiversity frameworks,the South African state constructs ABS agreements that elide complex,historically wrought subjectivities in favor of essentialist renderings of life under centralized chieftaincy. Alongside segregationist laws and economic development in the country,ABS schemes are thus entrenching—and in some instances expanding— apartheid-era boundaries and configurations of power. As a result, pharmaceuticals have become a site of contention over the status and content of \"custom.\" ",

Second, it contrasts existing scholarship—which largely describes contexts characterized by historical continuity in the leadership of chiefs—with a situation in which rights expand customary subjectivity into areas of the country where chiefs were virtually nonexistent for over l40 years.4 Third, Pelargonium offers a window into ethnic boundary construction in indigenous claims to culture as property.

The festival took place at Ntaba kaNdoda, the erstwhile national temple of the Ciskei, located in the region's wooded hills (see Figure 4). Under apartheid,one of the homeland's presidents,Lennox Sebe,had hoped that constructing the temple would bolster the link between his ideology of ethnic nationalism and a precolonial,royal past (Peires l989). Sebe's government even repatriated and interred at the temple's graveyard— known as the Heroes'Acre—the remains of the region's most famous warrior chief, who had died in imperial confinement on Robben Island in l873.But the burial event and the memory of the warrior chief ultimately contrasted a genuine chief's anticolonial legacy with Sebe's clearly manufactured one.As a result, Sebe's government stripped the warrior chief's descendant of his authority and exiled him from the homeland (Peires 1989).

Yet the actual nature of this relationship has less to do with an inherent tension between static poles of rights and custom, or individual and community, than with historically situated struggles over the actual status and content of these volatile abstractions (Claassens 20l3; Robins 20o8). Clearly isomorphism,familiarity,and mutuality characterize the contemporary collision of such abstractions as much as tension does.One example is the chiefs'increasing capacity to link their local authority with global capital and international rights discourses.Another is the shared (and ultimately convenient) elision of diverse interests and identities in the Ciskei by traditional leaders,DEA officials，and pharmaceutical-company representatives. “Indigeneity”features prominently in both,and the fact that the concept's deployment accords with segregationist thinking about ABS stakeholders in the Ciskei is likely not coincidental.“The UN concept of‘indigeneity,'” Sarah Ives provocatively argues,“is notably analogous to South African apartheid-era ideologies that called for maintaining and reproducing ‘distinctive' peoples and cultures in separate environments and through (ostensibly) separate systems of governance\"(20l4,700).

One outcome is the emergence of what some have called a“global conjuncture of belonging\" (Geschiere 20o9,l；see also Li 2007)，or ever-increasing concern with cultural identity and group classification at local,national, and transnational scales of power. Much of the anthropological work on this conjuncture has justifiably emphasized boundary closure,displacement,and exclusion in the contemporary construction of indigenous collective belonging. Yet, as a point of articulation between indigenous political legitimization and the interests of global capital,ABS in the Ciskei highlights a different trend. Beyond closure and the deepening of lines of distinction between groups, the strategic expansion of indigenous group-membership-indeed a politics of forced enrollment or ethnic capture—can be equally integral as a mode of capitalist, extraction-oriented accumulation.
