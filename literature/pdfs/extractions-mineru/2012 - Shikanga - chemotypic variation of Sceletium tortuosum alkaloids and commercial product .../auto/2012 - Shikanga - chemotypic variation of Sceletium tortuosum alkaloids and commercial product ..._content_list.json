Mesembrine-type alkaloids are the main active compounds responsible for the therapeutic properties of the plant. In this investigation, GC–MS was used to evaluate the variability in the mesembrine-type alkaloid content of 151 specimens of S. tortuosum growing wild in 31 localities in the south-western region of South Africa. In addition, the variability of the mesembrine-type alkaloid content of eight commercial products was determined. The total alkaloid content of wild plant material was found to vary between 0.11 and 1.99% of dry weight. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis grouped the plants growing in the wild into five main chemotypes (A, B, C, D and E). Chemotype A is represented by samples devoid of mesembrine-type alkaloids, while chemotypes B, C and E are characterised by high levels of mesembrenol (64.96–95.55%), mesembrine (51.25–92.50%) and mesembrenone (50.86– 72.51%), respectively. Chemotype D is an intermediate cluster representing specimens containing all four alkaloids in moderate amounts. Qualitative differences in the alkaloid profiles were observed between and within different populations of S. tortuosum, as well as among the investigated products. Mesembrine was identified as the main alkaloid constituent in most of the commercial products analysed. Mesembrenol, mesembrine and mesembrenone can be used as marker compounds for quality monitoring of S. tortuosum raw materials and products. ",

The species is used in the treatment of psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative diseases (Gomes et al., 2009). It is mainly distributed in the Karroid areas of the Cape region of South Africa (Gerbaulet, 1996) and is locally referred to as “kanna” or “canna” (Khoi) and “kougoed” (Afrikaans) (Gericke and van Wyk, 1999). The use of Sceletium in South Africa was documented as early as 1685 (Smith et al., 1996) and trade in this plant as a commodity took place in the Little Karoo, in the mid-nineteenth century (Digby, 2005). This area was previously known as “Cannaland” and is still referred to as “Kannaland”, the name derived from the Sceletium growing there. ",

Commercial cultivation of S. tortuosum has expanded in recent years and is carried out in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa, as well as in Namibia (www.Sceletium.org/cultivation.htm). Although South Africa is the main producer of Sceletium raw material and products, many companies (mainly internet-based), trading in Sceletium raw materials and manufactured products, have been established in various parts of the world including the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and China. In 2009, the South African company HG&H Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd. was granted the country’s first integrated export and bioprospecting permit, allowing it to export the first standardised extract of S. tortuosum under the trade mark Zembrin\u0003 (Patnala and Kanfer, 2009).

Dried plant material (aerial parts; leaves and twigs) is typically chewed and the resulting saliva and plant juices swallowed; it is also consumed in the form of teas, decoctions and tinctures and is sometimes smoked and used as snuff. In recent years, Sceletium has received a great deal of commercial interest due to its potential as an adaptogen for relieving stress in healthy people, and for treating a broad range of psychological, psychiatric and inflammatory conditions (Gericke, 2001). The number of websites advertising Sceletium raw materials and products in various formulations, including tablets, extracts, sprays, capsules and tinctures, is increasing rapidly (Patnala and Kanfer, 2009).

Biomarkers or pharmacologically active compounds are generally used as standards in the quality control of traditional medicines (Li et al., 2007). Various techniques, including chemical profiling of secondary metabolites and metabolomics have been useful tools for the evaluation and QC of herbal materials and derived products. Chromatographic (HPLC, GC and HPTLC), spectrometric (MS and NMR) and vibrational spectroscopic techniques (MIR, NIR and Raman spectroscopy), have been applied in the quality assessment of phytomedicines and their raw materials (Hu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007). The complexity of data (multivariate data) collected from analytical techniques makes classical statistical methods of data analysis challenging (Van der Kooy et al., 2008). Chemometric techniques such as principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) analysis, have thus become important scientific tools for faster analysis of multivariate data. Multivariate data are complex experimental data arising from multiple variables measured for multiple numbers of observations (samples) and require multivariate projection methods, such as PCA and PLS, to simplify the complex data.

The indigenous cultural relevance, potential health applications of S. tortuosum and the psychoactive alkaloids, as well as the increasing commercial interest in the species, prompted this investigation of the phytochemical variation of mesembrine-type alkaloids in wild populations of S. tortuosum plants and in manufactured products, to establish the range of chemotypes present in this species, and their provenances.

The initial oven temperature of 259 \u0002C was held for 2 min, then increased to 262 \u0002C at a rate of 20 \u0002C/min and held constant for 6 min. An HP-5MS 5% phenyl methyl siloxane column (30 m 250 mm i.d. 0.25 mm film thickness) was used to achieve the desired separation. The flow of helium (carrier gas) was maintained at 1.4 ml/min. Spectra were recorded after electron impact ionisation at 70 eV (35–550 m/z). A transfer line temperature of 280 \u0002C was maintained. Four psychoactive alkaloids namely mesembrenol, mesembranol, mesembrine, and mesembrenone, were identified in the extracts within an 8 min run. Retention times were used as the primary criterion for peak identification in the extracts and the mixtures were also spiked with the reference standards. However, comparison of the mass spectra of the peaks in the extracts with those of authentic standards and data from the NIST\u0003 Library (Version 2004) proved to be useful for further confirmation.

Variations in the profiles of the target alkaloids were observed between plants obtained from the same population and between different populations. For instance, samples collected on the south side of Oudtshoorn Hill (L3), were found to produce all four alkaloids, while those growing on the northern side of the hill (L4) were devoid of the compounds. This could imply that variations in weather patterns, such as precipitation, could influence the alkaloid profiles of the plants, since the northern side of the hill is the leeward side, while the southern side is the windward side. A similar trend was also observed for samples obtained from the various localities in Volmoed area (L24–L31), which lie to the south of the Oudtshoorn Hills. All the samples from this region contained the four alkaloids, although in variable ratios. Of the specimens collected from four localities in Calitzdorp (L7–L10), the alkaloids were only detected in those collected from L7 and L8. In these samples, mesembrine was the main constituent (61.01–92.50%). Samples collected from two localities in Toorwater L14 and L15, showed intra-population variability of the alkaloid profiles.

Subsequently, the data were log transformed in order to produce normalised data to prevent over-expression of large variance variables at the expense of small variance variables (Eriksson et al., 2006). A three component PCA model was constructed for the GC–MS data, which explained 98.3% of the total variation in the X matrix (R2X(cum) 0.983). The goodness of prediction of the model was 87.5% (Q2(cum) 0.875) (N 151, K 4), where N represents the number of observations (samples), while K represents the number of variables (alkaloids) in the data set. According to Eriksson et al. (2006), a good model is characterised by R2 and Q2 values above 0.5, with the difference between the two values less than 0.2.

The mesembranol (\u00046.95%) and mesembrine (\u00043.99%) content of the samples in this cluster were relatively very low, although a few samples contained as much as 27.34% of mesembrenone. Specimens comprising Chemotype C were observed to have high levels of mesembrine (\u000551.25%). In the majority of these samples, the relative amounts of mesembrenol and mesembrenone were either low or undetected. Chemotype D is placed specifically as an intermediate cluster, since the specimens contained all four alkaloids in moderate amounts. Samples in Chemotype D were observed to contain up to 42.64% mesembrenol, 37.03% mesembranol, 48.13% mesembrine and 54.06% mesembrenone. In addition to having relatively low amounts of mesembrenol, mesembranol and mesembrine, mesembrenone was the main constituent of specimens in Chemotype E (\u000550.86%). Chemotypes D and E displayed some overlap, resulting from specimens containing all four alkaloids in variable amounts, but with high mesembrenone levels ( 50.86%).

        "text": "In vivo experimental evidence has also suggested that PDE4 inhibitors can reverse depression, improve cognition and alleviate anxiety (O’Donnell and Zhang, 2004). S. tortuosum plants with relatively high mesembrenone content, and isolated mesembrenone, can thus act as dual serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and PDE4 inhibitors, while plant material with relatively high amounts of mesembrine, as well as pure mesembrine, can act as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. The therapeutic advantages of dual inhibition of serotonin re-uptake and PDE4 inhibition include the possibility of using a lower dose of plant material containing both mesembrenone and mesembrine (Chemotypes D and E) to achieve the desired effect (Cashman et al., 2009). For propagation, it is necessary to select the plant belonging to the appropriate chemotype to ensure consistency in the alkaloid content and maximum effect at lower doses. ",

        "text": "These results are consistent with a previous report indicating variability in the distribution of alkaloids in Sceletium plants cultivated in different places (Herre, 1971). Although the author reported that alkaloids were not produced by S. tortuosum plants cultivated in Germany, they were produced by those cultivated in the USA. Due to the variability of alkaloids in this species, harvesting of Sceletium samples from the wild for propagation purposes could be challenging, since inconsistencies in the alkaloid profiles are evident, even for plants growing within the same locality. Factors such as geography, soil-type, altitude, precipitation, genetics, growth season, time of harvesting, storage conditions and method of processing are known to affect the yield and composition of secondary metabolites produced by a plant (Laasonen et al., 2002). These factors may cause inconsistencies in the chemical profiles of specimens of the same species growing in different localities. The chemical profiles of S. tortuosum samples collected from different localities could also be influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions. However, variations observed between plants growing in the same locality indicate that the differences may be attributed to genetic variability and may not necessarily depend on geographical and environmental factors alone.

        "text": "Intra-specific variations of the profiles of the four alkaloids within and between different populations of S. tortuosum were observed. Chemotypic variation in the phytochemical profiles, based on mesembrine-type alkaloid composition, of S. tortuosum resulted in the identification of five chemotypes. Individual chemotypes identified were not restricted to particular geographical areas. The relative contributions of mesembrenol, mesembrine and mesembrenone, are useful for quality assurance of S. tortuosum raw materials and products, and for assigning the source raw plant material to one of the five identified chemotypes.
