In several phase III trials in patients with moderate to (very) severe COPD and in patients with symptoms of chronic bronchitis and recurrent exacerbations, roflumilast showed sustained clinical efficacy by improving lung function and by reducing exacerbation rates. These beneficial effects have also been demonstrated when added to long-acting bronchodilators (both LABA and LAMA), underscoring the anti-inflammatory activity of roflumilast in COPD. Pooled data analysis showed overall mild to moderate, mostly self-limiting adverse events, mainly consisting of nausea, diarrhea and weight loss. In this review we discuss the results of the 4 registration studies showing promising effects of roflumilast in COPD and provide an overview of the topics that still need to be addressed. ",

These features present as fixed airway obstruction, hyperinflation, dyspnea, mucus hypersecretion and chronic cough. In addition, there is an impairment of the overall health status [2]. The morbidity and mortality due to COPD is increasing worldwide [2]. The major cause of COPD is cigarette smoking, although other environmental pollutants may also serve as triggers in susceptible individuals. These insults induce chronic inflammation and remodeling, including structural changes and destruction of alveolar tissue, within the lung [2-5]. ",

The destruction of alveolar tissue (emphysema) is thought to be caused by the release of proteinase (such as matrix metalloproteinase from alveolar macrophages) or as a consequence of an autoimmune response (e.g. CD8+ T lymphocytes) [6]. Chronic airway inflammation may induce several aspects of airway remodeling, exemplified by goblet cell hyperplasia and enlargement of submucosal glands, which contribute to the excessive mucus production in subjects with chronic bronchitis. Peribronchiolar fibrosis in distal airways is another feature of remodeling, which can induce disruption of the parenchymal attachments to small airways promoting collapse on expiration and hyperinflation [3]. More recently, evidence was provided that the abnormalities seen in COPD are not only restricted to the airways, but also systemically present [7]. ",

Alternatively, pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of COPD are still limited. Whilst the currently advocated treatment with long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) and/or long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) with or without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been shown to produce temporary improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance and quality of life, the evidence for reducing exacerbations [8] and, consequently, the rate of decline in lung function, is less convincing [2, 9]. Nor do these drugs improve the systemic features of COPD [10]. In contrast, several studies showed that LABAs may increase morbidity and mortality due to cardiac comorbidity in susceptible patients [11, 12]. Consequently, despite maximal treatment, too many COPD patients still remain symptomatic and experience exacerbations [2], indicating that the current treatment options lack sustained efficacy or disease-modifying properties. Hence, there is a large need of therapeutic modalities producing sustained clinical efficacy for a more optimal treatment of COPD. ",

        "text": "Phosphodiesterase inhibition is an old concept in the treatment of COPD which has been already described by Hirsch and colleagues in 1922 [13]. However, the application of the prototypic non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-inhibitors, aminophylline and theophylline, has been limited by many drug-interactions and a narrow dose-range, causing many dose-dependent, mostly cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects. Whilst theophylline may non-selectively target PDE, albeit at high concentrations, recent evidence points to inhibition of phosphoinositide 3 kinase as a target for the anti-inflammatory action of this drug [14]. In the past decade, interest in PDE-inhibitors has revived due to the identification of 11 different isoenzymes (PDE1-11) within the PDEsuperfamily. Each isoenzyme has different tissue subdivision and different properties, hence enabling targeted therapy with potentially fewer (systemic) side effects. In particular, in contrast to nonselective PDE-inhibition, there is considerable interest in selectively targeting the PDE4-isoenzyme, which is expressed in  inflammatory cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages) and structural cells (e.g. fibroblasts, epithelium, sensory nerves, smooth muscle cells) within the lung [15] (Table 1). The presence of the PDE4-isoenzyme in many of the cell types implicated in COPD would make it a promising target for disease modifying therapy, given the strong relationship between chronic airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion with increased decline in lung function [16].  Most of the (long-term) studies in COPD so far have been performed with the second generation of oral PDE4- inhibitors, cilomilast (Glaxo Smith Kline) and roflumilast (Nycomed), of which roflumilast possesses the best pharmacological profile (once daily dosing) combined with good clinical efficacy with overall mild and self limiting side effects [17]. In this review we will focus on the most recent clinical trials with the PDE4-inhibitor, roflumilast, showing clinical efficacy in patients with COPD. ",

Translating these observations into disease, PDE4-inhibition could offer a novel approach to anti-inflammatory and/or disease-modifying therapy. Whilst animal models of COPD are limited, there is some evidence showing that inhibition of PDE4 can suppress pro-inflammatory cell recruitment, cytokine and chemokine production and emphysematous changes to the lung [18-20]. However, early clinical trials with PDE4-inhibitors were met with mixed success. ",

The improvement in baseline lung function developed gradually, suggesting that, unlike current bronchodilators used in COPD, PDE4-inhibitors may modulate lung function by mechanisms unrelated to airway smooth muscle relaxation per se. Indeed, in contrast to salbutamol or ipratropium bromide, administration of cilomilast failed to produce an immediate bronchodilator response [23]. This is also consistent with numerous in vitro studies using isolated human bronchial tissues. In these studies, various PDE4-inhibitors appeared to be poor functional antagonists and produced modest relaxation of airway smooth muscle [24-28]. Another longer-term study with cilomilast confirmed the previously observed improvements in lung function and additionally showed a significant reduction in COPD exacerbations and improvements in quality of life scores [29]. The mechanism for these improvements can likely be attributed to an antiinflammatory activity. In this respect, cilomilast has been shown to reduce the number of several pro-inflammatory cells, implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, including CD8+T lymphocytes, CD86+ monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils in lung biopsies from subjects with COPD by approximately 40-50% [30]. This incomplete inhibition might account why the improvements in lung function were not maintained over the 12 week course of this study. Other possible explanations for the improvements in lung function, exacerbation rates and quality of life additional to the indirect bronchodilator effect of cilomilast seen in a majority of these clinical trials could be partly attributed to a modulation of sensory nerve function [31, 32]. A consequence of reduced sensory input to the central nervous system would be a decrease in parasympathetic outflow to the airways, a reduction in contraction of airway smooth muscle and submucosal gland secretion, both leading to improvements in airflow and symptoms. Alternatively, the activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) via elevating the level of cyclic AMP in airway epithelial cells could promote rehydration of the epithelial periciliary layer thereby facilitating mucociliary clearance of mucus and bacteria [33]. Indeed, PDE4 inhibitors can reduce mucus production and increase ciliary beat frequency of airway epithelial cells [34, 35]. ",

Apart from the effect on lung function, the focus of these trials was on the longer-term clinical efficacy of roflumilast based on GOLD-criteria: i.e. prevention and treatment of COPD-exacerbations in addition to safety/tolerability. The paper by Fabbri et al. reports the results of 2 clinical studies in COPD evaluating the effects of treatment with roflumilast versus placebo in addition to salmeterol (M2-127) or tiotropium (M2- 128), respectively [42]. In the first study (M2-127), after a placebo-run-in period of 4 weeks, patients with moderate to severe COPD were randomized to either roflumilast (n=466) or placebo (n=467) treatment in combination with salmeterol during 24 weeks. In the second study (M2-128), patients received either roflumilast (n=371) or placebo (n=372) in combination with tiotropium for 24 weeks [42]. Both studies included patient populations of chronic smokers or ex-smokers (≥10 packyears), none of them using inhaled corticosteroids at randomization. In the M2-128 (tiotropiumcombination) study, symptomatic patients with chronic cough and sputum production with frequent use of short-acting bronchodilators were included. In both studies, roflumilast was associated with consistent and sustained improvements in both the pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1. In the salmeterol-combination, the mean increase in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 versus placebo was 49 mL, while in the tiotropium-combination the mean increase mounted to 80 mL, respectively (p<0.0001). Furthermore, in both studies, patients on roflumilast tended to have fewer exacerbations. In both studies, the drop-out rate was larger in the roflumilast-arm with significantly more withdrawals in the salmeterol-roflumilast-arm (p=0.0019).

The inclusion criteria were based on a post-hoc analysis of a previous study, suggesting a decrease in exacerbations by roflumilast in this COPD-phenotype [40]. Initially, 44% of the patients were using ICS or LAMA or both: these drugs have been discontinued for the duration of the study (1 year). Concomitant use of short-acting beta2-agonists, short-acting muscarinic antagonists and LABA was allowed and at randomization; patients were stratified according to initial LABA use to allow a prespecified subgroup analysis. In both studies, after a 4 week placebo-run in period, patients received either roflumilast or placebo for 52 weeks on top of their existing anti-COPD medication. Based on pooled data analysis, in the roflumilast treated-patients, there was a mean increase in prebronchodilator FEV1 of 48 mL versus placebo (p<0.0001). Furthermore, compared to placebo, roflumilast produced a substantial decrease in both moderate and severe exacerbations by on mean 17% (p<0.0003). The improvement in lung function and reduction in exacerbations were independent of concomitant use of LABA or short-acting muscarinic antagonists or prior ICS-use or smoking behaviour. The mortality due to COPD was similar in both treatment-arms in both studies (2-3%). Similar adverse events as in the study by Fabbri et al. were reported: i.e. mainly CNS (head ache, insomnia and nausea) and gastrointestinal (diarrhea) complaints.  Although mostly selflimiting, these adverse events resulted in premature withdrawal in both roflumilast-arms during the first 4-12 weeks of the study. In addition, roflumilast produced a sustained, mean weight loss of 2.1 kg in mainly obese patients during the first 6 months of use.

Other evidence of an anti-inflammatory mechanism stems from in vitro studies which reported that cilomilast reduced the level of TNF-alpha (25% decrease), GMCSF (46% decrease) and neutrophil chemotactic factors (35% decrease) with no effect on IL-8 released by epithelial cells from COPD patients [45].

The reduction in exacerbations in COPD-patients treated with tiotropium bromide was not accompanied by a reduction in inflammatory cells or sputum cytokine or chemokine levels [46, 47]. Following treatment with this LAMA, sputum levels of pro-inflammatory mediators tended to rise, which could be a consequence of a reduction in mucus secretion, thereby concentrating the levels of these mediators. However, these changes are unlikely to be clinically relevant in view of their small magnitude (less than 2 fold) and improvements in lung function and reduction in exacerbations seen in large trials (Table 1). In contrast, there is evidence that glucocorticosteroids can reduce airway inflammation in COPD.  The number of pro-inflammatory cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells) in biopsies from 101 patients previously steroid-naïve (GOLD stages II and III) but who were treated with fluticasone showed a significant reduction in inflammatory cell numbers over a 2.5 year treatment period. As compared to placebo, the magnitude of the reduction in the number of COPDrelevant inflammatory cells in bronchial biopsies was approximately 25% at 6 months and 45 % at 30 months of treatment [48]. More importantly, in this long-term study, there was no evidence of any additive or synergistic anti-inflammatory effect with combination therapy (salmeterol and fluticasone) [48].

Although earlier studies showed that combination therapy was associated with anti-inflammatory activity [50] after 12-13 weeks of treatment, which may be superior to monotherapy with fluticasone [51], the clinical relevance of these effects is debatable in light of the lack of effect of this treatment on lung function parameters [51]. Interestingly, the effect of fluticasone monotherapy on airway neutrophil numbers is conflicting, with both reports of a reduction [48] and increase [52] and again, the differences could be due to the relatively short duration of treatment in a limited number of patients in these studies. Alternatively, there is evidence of a (relative) corticosteroid resistance in patients with COPD. Although recent studies yielded a number of possible mechanisms to explain this insensitivity, the central hypothesis implies the increase in oxidant burden within the lungs, resulting in reduction in the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC)-2. Accordingly, increasing the HDAC2-activity by PDE-inhibitors, phosphoinositide 3 kinase-delta inhibitors and macrolides could result in a reversal of corticosteroid resistance [53]. ",

Several strategies are available to avoid such problems. One possibility might be to develop subtype-selective PDE4-inhibitors since it has become dogma that side-effects like nausea are due exclusively to inhibition of the PDE4D isoenzymes  -  however, this viewpoint in not universally shared [15] and the recent discovery of selective brain-penetrant PDE4- inhibitors that are devoid of emesis [54] adds further weight against avoiding the targeting of PDE4D, particularly as this enzyme subtype is expressed in cells of interest to COPD.

A highly potent PDE4-inhibitor, UK-500,001 failed to demonstrate any improvement in baseline FEV1 in patients with moderate to severe COPD after 6 weeks of treatment [55].  In contrast, the inhaled PDE4-inhibitor, GSK256066, with low systemic exposure, was shown to attenuate the acute and late phase allergic airway response after 1 week of treatment [56], and whether this drug is clinically effective in COPD remains to be established.

Mixed PDE-inhibitors can serve to have additive or potentially synergistic actions on cell function [27, 33, 57] and whilst early mixed PDE3/4 inhibitors evaluated by the inhaled route showed limited activity [58, 59] this was attributed to their short retention time within the lung.

Adverse events mostly became evident during the first 4-12 weeks and although usually subsiding with continued treatment, these events caused an increased patient withdrawal in the roflumilast-arms.

The largest absolute weight loss was seen in patients with a BMI >30.

Similarly, PDE4-inhibition promoted chemokine expression in monocyte/macrophage in culture [65] suggesting that this drug class might be anticipated to potentially promote inflammation.  However, these data are not consistent with numerous studies documenting anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4-inhibitors (Table 1). Indeed, roflumilast treatment alone failed to significantly increase macrophage and neutrophil cell number in the lung in a preclinical model of smoke-induced inflammation, but reduced the rise in macrophage and neutrophil cell numbers caused by cigarette smoke exposure [18, 66]. Similarly, human clinical data shows that the PDE4-inhibitors, cilomilast and roflumilast, reduce inflammatory cell numbers in the lung compartment [43, 67]. In conclusion, ample evidence has been provided that the PDE4-inhibitors cilomilast and roflumilast, at a clinically relevant dose, are capable of reducing airway inflammation. ",

In patients with symptomatic (very) severe COPD with chronic cough, sputum and prone to frequent exacerbations, roflumilast caused relief through improvements in lung function and, more importantly, through decrease in exacerbation rates, in addition to their existing anti-COPD therapy. Since the improvements in lung function by roflumilast have been additive to concomitant use of LABA or LAMA, this suggests anti-inflammatory activity.
