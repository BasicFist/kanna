        "text": "Abstract Plants that use fog as an important watersource frequently have a rosette growth habit. The performance of this morphology in relation to fog interception has not been studied. Some first-principles from physics predict that narrow leaves, together with other ancillary traits (large number and high flexibility of leaves, caudices, and/or epiphytism) which constitute the ‘‘narrow-leaf syndrome’’ should increase foginterception efficiency. This was tested using aluminum models of rosettes that differed in leaf length, width and number and were exposed to artificial fog. The results were validated using seven species of Tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes. The total amount of fog intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf area, while narrow leaves maximized interception efficiency (measured as interception per unit area). The number of leaves in the rosettes is physically constrained because wide-leafed plants can only have a few blades. At the limits of this constraint, net fog interception was independent of leaf form, but interception efficiency was maximized by large numbers of narrow leaves. Atmospheric Tillandsia species show the narrow-leaf syndrome. Their fog interception efficiencies were correlated to the ones predicted from aluminum-model data. In the larger xerophytic rosette species, the interception efficiency was greatest in plants showing the narrow-leaf syndrome. The adaptation to fog-harvesting in several narrow-leaved rosettes was tested for evolutionary convergence in 30 xerophytic rosette species using a comparative method. There was a significant evolutionary tendency towards the development of the narrow-leaf syndrome the closer the species grew to areas where fog is frequently available. This study establishes convergence in a very wide group of plants encompassing genera as contrasting as Tillandsia and Agave as a result of their dependence on fog. ",

We have suggested the term nebulophyte for species that use fog as an important water source (Martorell 2002), such as epiphytic bromeliads (Mez 1904; Smith and Downs 1974; Martin 1994). Nebulophytes may also be large groundliving plants, such as the trees, shrubs and columnar cacti from the hyperarid Atacama Desert (Rundel and Mahu 1976; Rundel et al. 1991). Large rosette plants, such as some Agavaceae and Nolinaceae, constitute as much as 88% of the individuals and 54% of the vegetation cover in the montane rosette scrub of arid NorthAmerican mountains where fog provides as much water as rainfall. It is likely that these rosettes are also nebulophytes (Martorell and Ezcurra 2002). ",

The reason for this may be that rosettes resemble funnels that conduct water to the plant’s roots or to the central tank in ‘‘pitcher plant’’ bromeliads. The stem flow of some Agavaceae is highly efficient, even during very small (1 mm) rain events (Gentry 1982; Ramı´rez de Arellano 1996). We have observed that fog may also initiate stem flow in dryland rosettes, and the tanks of some bromeliads are known to be replenished entirely by fog water (Rundel and Dillon 1998). ",

In these ‘‘atmospheric’’ species, conducting water to the plant’s base would be futile or even disadvantageous, so water interception – rather than its subsequent conduction – should be optimized. There are some remarkable morphological convergences in nebulophytes that may serve this purpose. Atmospheric bromeliads have very narrow leaves (Benzing 1990), as it also happens in the Agavaceae and Nolinaceae that grow in foggy mountains. Nebulophytic lichens and mosses have narrow thalli, a trait that increases water uptake rates at the organism’s surface (Larson 1981). This may also apply to bromeliads, but Agavaceae or Nolinaceae do not absorb water at the leaf surface. Thus, an alternative hypothesis is needed to explain the reiterated convergence of narrow leaves or thalli in nebulophytes. In this paper we suggest that narrow surfaces, in addition to enlarging water-absorption rates, are an adaptation that increases fog interception. ",

This relationship means that large leaves have thicker boundary layers (Nobel 1991). Fog is composed of water droplets having an average size of 20 lm; as such, they have a large surface:volume ratio compared to larger drops (Jones 1992). When they cross the boundary layer, their large surfaces are subject to strong friction forces, while their reduced mass retains little kinetic energy. As a result, the fog droplets are easily slowed down by the boundary layer, where they are swept away by a slow laminar air stream flowing parallel to the object’s surface (Welty 1984). Only a small fraction of the droplets – known as impaction efficiency – has enough energy to follow its original (perpendicular or oblique to the surface) trajectory, ultimately colliding with the plant. The impaction efficiency is inversely proportional to the thickness of the boundary layer, and it is increased in the presence of turbulence. Turbulent eddies may drive droplets that are far from the plant into its surface. Strong turbulence also drags the water into the leeward side of the leaf, where no droplets would normally collide (Jones 1992). ",

Leaf form is variable in rosettes, and the length:width ratio of the nearly triangular leaves of xerophytes ranges from 2 (Agave potatorum) to 265 (Dasylirion longissimum), possibly reaching above 450 in some Tillandsia. (2) Fast winds reduce boundary layers and provide sufficient kinetic energy to droplets. Since wind-speed increases with distance from the ground, rosettes should be placed high above the soil. This may be achieved either by having a stem or caudex, as in some Yucca and Nolina, or by being an epiphyte. (3) Turbulence is induced by complex surfaces (Jones 1992), such as many-leafed rosettes, or by flexible leaves that whisk in the wind. Therefore, narrow leaves, together with some ancillary traits (leaf distance from the ground and flexible leaves in large numbers), should characterize efficient fog harvesters. These co-occurring traits would then constitute what we have named the narrow-leaf syndrome. ",

According to the homology approach, a trait can be proved to be adaptive if it increases the performance of the organisms that possess it. Detailed studies on the evolution of the trait are often needed that lack generality because the evolution of a trait on any species is a ‘‘historical unique’’ (Coddington 1994). The convergence approach states that adaptation may be shown through the repeated evolution of the same trait in different taxa as a result of the same evolutionary pressures. This approach has the advantage of generality and provides strong evidence to discard alternative explanatory factors (Coddington 1994; Wenzel and Carpenter 1994). A highly widespread convergence rules out exaptation and, therefore, evinces adaptation rather than mere adaptive value (Harvey and Pagel 1991; Pagel 1994). However, being correlative, the convergence method cannot resolve a causal relation between the traits and the hypothetical pressures that shaped them. ",

The homologist’s data on performance is needed to discriminate between Larson’s hypothesis (high water-uptake rate) and ours (high fog interception efficiency). Convergence, on the other hand, would establish the narrowleaf syndrome as an evolutionary trend, allowing us to understand phenomena such as the high diversity of rosettes in cloud belts (Martorell and Ezcurra 2002). Performance was defined in terms of fog interception as the net amount of water gained per time unit. However, the amount of water that suffices for a small plant may not be enough for a large one. Thus, we defined a second measure of performance, interception efficiency, as fog interception in relation to total leaf area. Leaf area estimates plant size and the amount of resources (plant surface) invested in fog-catchment. Performance was measured for plants with different morphologies. Once the adaptive value of the narrowleaf syndrome was established, its generality was tested by means of a comparative analysis (Harvey and Pagel 1991) using xerophytic rosettes, because these are found in a larger set of families than only epiphytes, thereby allowing us to achieve a greater level of generality.

The use of models overcomes the difficulty of finding different plant species that differ only in the characteristics we are interested in, without showing simultaneous changes in other morphological variables. We chose aluminum for building the rosette models because it is a light material that allowed the the amount of water intercepted to be measured precisely by weighing. Because of the non-linear effect that size was expected to have on water interception (Eq. 1), it was important to use models of at least three different sizes. The leaves of the models were triangular, with lengths of 12, 18 and 24 cm, and there were three leaf-form variants. Leaf form was defined as the ratio of length to width, and set to values of 2.67, 4 and 8. Models with larger form indices had more leaves, so the overall area was the same for all models of the same size. Finally, for each combination of leaf length and form, two variants were assembled, one with twice as many leaves as the other (Table 1). Leaves were inserted at the base of the models in verticils of six, and the angle between them was obtained by dividing 60\u0002 (=360/6) by the number of verticils, so the density of leaves pointing to any direction was the same. The leaves were then folded upwards. The angle of each was obtained by dividing 90\u0002 by the number of leaves, so the uppermost leaf was vertical, the lowermost one was horizontal and the remainder of the leaves covered homogeneously the range between both extremes. Folding was performed in a spiraling order in an attempt to simulate real phylotaxis. The model’s surface was flat, with no pubescence or ornamentation. ",

The growth site itself is not a trait of the species, but if its distribution is affected by attributes upon which selection may act, such as morphology (see Wainwright 1994 and references therein for a thorough discussion on the form-environment relationship), then the rosette plants showing the narrow-leaf syndrome should occur preferentially in altitudes of the montane rosette scrub, where fog is available (Martorell and Ezcurra 2002). We calculated the differences between this altitude and the elevational centroid of the distribution of each species. A relationship between this relative position and the form index (species score along the first principal component) was sought by means of independent comparisons (Harvey and Pagel 1991). The required ancestral character states for the cladogram were calculated using the averaging rule algorithm, which reduces the character differences along the tree so that the evolutionary changes are minimized. This is achieved by iteratively calculating for each node the average of the character states estimated for all the adjacent nodes (Huey and Bennett 1986; Harvey and Pagel 1991). We followed the methodology of Trevelyan et al. (1990) to calculate the comparison corresponding to the only polytomic node. We did not use a phylogeny but a mixture of results from different sources, so the data cannot be controlled for homoscedasticity as required by many independent comparisons methods. Because the assumptions of the model were dubious, a sign test was used to assess the significance of the independent comparisons more reliably (Harvey and Pagel 1991). Iterations, independent comparisons, and P-values were calculated with EXCEL (release 2003). ",

Likewise, the narrow-leaved rosette form of xerophytes and epiphytes may serve other purposes besides fog catchment.

During the fog simulations it was observed that the leeward leaves intercepted water mainly at the tips, which seem to project beyond the fog-shadow of the windward leaves.

Net interception is of obvious importance for all plants, but in atmospheric bromeliads where water uptake occurs in the leaf itself, interception efficiency is a more appropriate measure of performance since it is a function of the absorptive area. The same may be true for lichens, mosses and pines, where at least part of the fog water is absorbed above ground (Leyton and Armitage 1968; Boucher et al. 1995). There are two other advantages of interception efficiency over net interception as a measure of performance: first, it is related to plant size and, therefore, with the amount of water that the individual may require; second, since gas exchange occurs at the leaf surface, water uptake rates are implicitly compared to potential transpiration loss rates. When water is absorbed at the ground level, as it occurs in xerophytic rosettes living in foggy areas, a high net interception is needed as this will drive a significant quantity of water to the soil. This may be achieved by increasing leaf width, length and number. However, if a rosette evolves towards the maximum possible number of leaves imposed by the physical constraint, leaf form no longer affects net interception. At this point, developing narrow leaves and therefore increasing interception efficiency may be advantageous, since it would result in a faster saturation of the leaf surface and earlier initiation of the stem flow, thereby allowing access to shorter or lighter fog events. This agrees with the pattern observed in epiphytes that have fewer leaves than xerophytes for any given leafform. The maximization of interception efficiency seems to be achieved in atmospheric Tillandsia by means of having few leaves (Fig. 1), while xerophytic rosettes optimize net interception and efficiency by having as many narrow leaves as allowed by the physical constraint.

However, it remains unclear whether there is a trade-off or a synergism between morphological traits that optimize fog or PAR interception. Apart from leaf number, there are no data available on how the leaf form affects PAR interception. However, it must be noted that instantaneous PAR interception is remarkably similar in three agave species with many narrow leaves or a few wide ones (see Fig. 5.8 in Nobel 1988), suggesting that shading in leafier species may be ameliorated by their narrower leaves. Long caudices may also have a positive effect on light interception. Future research should assess if the narrow-leaf syndrome increases PAR interception in the relatively shady cloud-belts. ",

Among the xerophytic rosettes, several Nolinaceae have fibrous tufts at the leaf apices, various Yucca have filaments at the leaf margins and a large proportion of the species in the genera Hechtia and Puya are at least partially pubescent. It has been frequently observed that fruticose lichens have ciliate margins and the fog-absorbing needles of Pinus radiata have several tubular waxy outgrows (Leyton and Armitage 1968), both of which that may increase interception efficiency. However, several xerophytic rosettes are completely glabrous.

The water impoundment in tank bromeliads – which are among the most primitive Tillandsia (Gilmartin 1983; Crayn et al. 2004) – would not occur if the internodes were long, and it would be useless if the leaves could not absorb water directly on their surface. In seven out of the nine subgenera in Tillandsia, tank species gave rise to atmospheric taxa (Gilmartin 1983). With the evolutionary disappearance of the tank, and with roots serving only as holdfasts, there is no longer a need to conduct and accumulate water in the base of the plant. Since one of the main functions of the funnel-like rosette morphology is thus lost, increasing the length of the internodes would decrease the fog-shadow effect among leaves without any negative effects for the plant. This is supported by our data: non-rosette species had significantly higher efficiencies than rosette ones. Thus, the rosette habit in atmospheric Tillandsia can be considered to be an ancestral trait that has lost its adaptive value and become more of a burden than an asset for the most recently derived nebulophytes.

The plants with narrower leaves (Agave stricta, Brahea nitida) have much larger efficiencies than broad-leafed rosettes. Other taxonomic groups that rely on fogs seemingly resort to narrow structures to capture water droplets. Lichens and mosses with pendant forms with long internodes are best adapted for fog interception (Ku¨ rschner and Parolly 1998; Ku¨ rschner and Frey 1999). Cacti on coastal deserts and pines in foggy areas condense large amounts of water on their spines and needles (Mooney et al. 1977; Boucher et al. 1995; Dawson 1998).

We believe this constitutes evidence for a widespread convergence into a narrow range of morphologies. Several of the attributes of this polyphyletic set are the ones that we expected for nebulophytes: large numbers of narrow, long leaves without ornamentation growing on top of caudices. Leaves are curved towards the apex, so the water intercepted at the tips does not leak outwards (Table 3). Flexible leaves, another trait that is believed to optimize fog interception, was also found in Nolinaceae and Arecaceae.

Spongy caudices, enlarged leaf sheaths or several, very narrow but still succulent leaves have solved the problem of water impoundment in montane species and epiphytes without compromising the narrow-leaf syndrome. These species did not become massive leaf succulents because, being nebulophytes, they seemingly evolved under the selective pressure for long, slender leaves and fog capture. ",

        "text": "1. The net interception of fog in rosette plants increases with leaf area. Thus, larger plants with several wide, long leaves intercept more fog. Fog interception efficiency, in contrast, is closely related to the thickness of the boundary layer on the leaf. The most efficient fog-harvesting rosettes should have a small number of narrow and long leaves.   \n2. There is a physical constraint in the number of leaves a plant may have. Wide-leaved rosettes can only have a few blades, while individuals with many leaves are only found among species with narrow ones. At the limits set by this constraint, net fog interception is independent of leaf-form, but interception efficiency is maximized by having several narrow leaves. These attributes usually occur in nature simultaneously with other ancillary traits (caudices, epiphytism, and/or flexible leaves), thereby constituting a syndrome that characterizes fog-harvesting species.

Their fog interception efficiencies are correlated to the ones predicted on the basis of size, form and number of their leaves. Their efficiencies are enhanced by means of trichomes and long internodes. In the large xerophytic rosette species, the most efficient plants in terms of fog interception are also those with narrow leaves and their ancillary traits. ",

These plants have developed succulence in several organs apart from the leaves, which allows the storage of water while keeping slender blades that are suitable for fog-harvesting. ",
