Drug addiction has been conceptualized as a disorder that involves elements of both impulsivity and compulsivity that yield a composite addiction cycle composed of three stages: ‘binge/intoxication’, ‘withdrawal/negative affect’, and ‘preoccupation/anticipation’ (craving). Animal and human imaging studies have revealed discrete circuits that mediate the three stages of the addiction cycle with key elements of the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum as a focal point for the binge/intoxication stage, a key role for the extended amygdala in the withdrawal/negative affect stage, and a key role in the preoccupation/anticipation stage for a widely distributed network involving the orbitofrontal cortex–dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and insula involved in craving and the cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices in disrupted inhibitory control. The transition to addiction involves neuroplasticity in all of these structures that may begin with changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system and a cascade of neuroadaptations from the ventral striatum to dorsal striatum and orbitofrontal cortex and eventually dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and extended amygdala. The delineation of the neurocircuitry of the evolving stages of the addiction syndrome forms a heuristic basis for the search for the molecular, genetic, and neuropharmacological neuroadaptations that are key to vulnerability for developing and maintaining addiction.

The occasional but limited use of an abusable drug is clinically distinct from escalated drug use, loss of control over limiting drug intake, and the emergence of chronic compulsive drug-seeking that characterizes addiction. The critical nature of the distinction between drug use, abuse, and dependence has been illuminated by data showing that approximately $1 5 . 6 \\%$ (29 million) of the US adult population will go on to engage in nonmedical or illicit drug use at some time in their lives, with approximately $2 . 9 \\%$ (5.4 million) going on to substance dependence on illicit drugs (Grant and Dawson, 1998; Grant et al, 2004).

Impulse control disorders are largely associated with positive reinforcement mechanisms (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).

These three stages are conceptualized as interacting with each other, becoming more intense, and ultimately leading to the pathological state known as addiction (Koob and Le Moal, 1997; Table 2). The transition from occasional drug use to addiction involves neuroplasticity in all of these elements and may begin with initial drug use in vulnerable individuals or individuals at particularly vulnerable developmental periods (eg, adolescence; Koob et al, 2008b). The present review focuses on the brain neurocircuitry that is engaged at each stage of the addiction cycle, how it changes with increasing engagement with drugs of abuse, and how it interacts to produce the pathological state known as addiction.

Solomon and Corbit (1974) postulated that hedonic, affective, or emotional states, once initiated, are automatically modulated by the central nervous system with mechanisms that reduce the intensity of hedonic feelings. Positive hedonic responses in drug use occur shortly after presentation of a stimulus, correlate closely with the intensity, quality, and duration of the reinforcer, and show tolerance and affective or hedonic withdrawal (abstinence). In contrast, negative hedonic responses follow the positive hedonic responses, are sluggish in onset, slow to build up to an asymptote, slow to decay, and get larger with repeated exposure. The role of opponent processes begins early in drug-taking, reflects changes in the brain reward and stress systems, and later forms one of the major motivations for compulsivity in drug-taking in the form of a motivational withdrawal syndrome.

Indeed, some have argued that the development of such a negative affective state can define dependence relative to addiction (Russell, 1976; Baker et al, 1987) and that such a negative affective state contributes to compulsivity through negative reinforcement mechanisms (Koob and Le Moal, 2005).

For example, opioidaddicted subjects meet most of the DSM criteria for addiction, including dramatic tolerance and withdrawal (classic symptoms associated with physical dependence) and most of the symptoms associated with motivational withdrawal. A pattern of intravenous or smoked drugtaking evolves, including intoxication, tolerance, escalation in intake, and profound dysphoria, physical discomfort, and somatic withdrawal signs during abstinence. Intense preoccupation with obtaining opioids (craving) develops that often precedes the somatic signs of withdrawal and is linked not only to stimuli associated with obtaining the drug but also to stimuli associated with withdrawal and the aversive motivational state. A pattern develops in which the drug must be obtained to avoid the severe dysphoria and discomfort of abstinence. Other drugs of abuse follow a similar pattern but may involve more the binge/intoxication stage (psychostimulants) or less binge/intoxication and more withdrawal/negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation stages (nicotine and cannabinoids).

Here, using intravenous drug self-administration, extended access to drugs is associated with an escalation in intake over days (Koob, 2009a). Such increased self-administration also has been observed with alcohol in which rats drink excessively during acute and protracted withdrawal from dependence induction using either chronic liquid diet or chronic vapor exposure (Gilpin and Koob, 2008). Animals made dependent on alcohol reliably obtain blood alcohol levels in the $1 0 0 { - } 1 5 0 \\mathrm { m g \\% }$ range, which are equivalent to the levels abused by moderate to heavy alcohol abusers. Changes in the reinforcing and incentive effects of the drug have been observed following extended access and induction of dependence and include increased progressive-ratio responding (Koob, 2009a), increased drug-induced reinstatement after extinction, decreased latency to goal time in a runway model for drug reward (Deroche-Gamonet et al, 2004), and increased resistance to punishment in which the animal will sustain higher aversive punishment to obtain drug (Vanderschuren and Everitt, 2004). Whether the enhanced drug-taking with extended access reflects a sensitization of reward (or of incentive motivation) or a reward-deficit state, or both, remains under discussion (Vezina, 2004). ",

        "text": "Our understanding of the neurobiological substrates for the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse can be traced to early work on the identification of a reward system in the brain with the discovery of electrical brain stimulation reward or intracranial self-stimulation by Olds and Milner (1954). Brain stimulation reward involves widespread neurocircuitry in the brain, but the most sensitive sites defined by the lowest thresholds involve the trajectory of the medial forebrain bundle that connects the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the basal forebrain (Olds and Milner, 1954). All drugs of abuse, when administered acutely, decrease brain stimulation reward thresholds (ie, increased reward; Kornetsky and Esposito, 1979) and when administered chronically increase reward thresholds during withdrawal (ie, decreased reward; see below). Although much emphasis was focused initially on the role of the ascending monoamine systems in the medial forebrain bundle in reward, first norepinephrine (Stein, 1962) and then dopamine (Crow, 1973; Wise, 1978), other nondopaminergic systems in the medial forebrain bundle clearly have a key role in mediating brain stimulation reward (Hernandez et al, 2006). Indeed, much work suggests that activation of the midbrain dopamine system has multiple roles to give incentive salience to stimuli in the environment (Robinson and Berridge, 1993) to promote performance of goal-directed behavior (Salamone et al, 2007) or activation in general (Le Moal and Simon, 1991). More recently, the hypothesis has been raised that the time course of dopamine signaling is a key factor, with the fastest time course predominantly having a preferential role in reward and valuation of predicted outcomes of behavior and steady activation of dopamine release having a preferential role in providing an enabling effect on specific behavior-related systems (Schultz, 2007). Work in the domain of the acute reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse supports this hypothesis in which the mesolimbic dopamine system is critical for the acute rewarding effects of psychostimulant drugs but has a more enabling function for all drugs of abuse.

Using a second-order schedule (Table 1), lesions of the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala blocked the acquisition of cocaine-seeking (Whitelaw et al, 1996). Similarly, when the nucleus accumbens core was selectively lesioned on one side of the brain and combined with dopamine receptor blockade in the contralateral dorsal striatum, no effect was observed in animals immediately after acquisition, but greatly decreased cocaine-seeking was observed in rats with stable responding on a second-order schedule (Belin and Everitt, 2008).

The extended amygdala receives numerous afferents from limbic structures such as the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus and sends efferents to the medial part of the ventral pallidum and a large projection to the lateral hypothalamus, thus further defining the specific brain areas that interface classical limbic (emotional) structures with the output of extrapyramidal motor system (Alheid et al, 1995). The extended amygdala has long been hypothesized to have a key role not only in fear conditioning (Le Doux, 2000) but also in the emotional component of pain processing (Neugebauer et al, 2004). ",

One prominent hypothesis is that dopamine systems are compromised in crucial phases of the addiction cycle, such as withdrawal, and lead to decreased motivation for nondrug-related stimuli and increased sensitivity to the abused drug (Melis et al, 2005; see brain imaging studies below). Psychostimulant withdrawal in humans is associated with fatigue, decreased mood and psychomotor retardation, and in animals is associated with decreased motivation to work for natural rewards (Barr and Phillips, 1999) and decreased locomotor activity (Pulvirenti and Koob, 1993), behavioral effects that may involve decreased dopaminergic function. Animals during amphetamine withdrawal show decreased responding on a progressive-ratio schedule for a sweet solution, and this decreased responding was reversed by the dopamine partial agonist terguride (Orsini et al, 2001), suggesting that low dopamine tone contributes to the motivational deficits associated with psychostimulant withdrawal. Decreases in activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system and decreases in serotonergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens occur during acute drug withdrawal from all major drugs of abuse in animal studies (Rossetti et al, 1992; Weiss et al, 1992, 1996).

Both the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the brain stress/ aversive system mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) are activated during withdrawal from chronic administration of all major drugs with abuse potential, with a common response of elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone, and amygdala CRF during acute withdrawal (Koob, 2008; Koob and Kreek, 2007). Acute withdrawal from all drugs of abuse also produces an aversive or anxiety-like state in which CRF and other stressrelated systems (including noradrenergic pathways) have key roles. ",

            "Figure 2. Neural circuitry associated with the three stages of the addiction cycle. (a) Binge/intoxication stage. Reinforcing effects of drugs may engage reward neurotransmitters and associative mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens shell and core and then engage stimulus–response habits that depend on the dorsal striatum. Two major neurotransmitters mediating the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse are dopamine and opioid peptides. (b) Withdrawal/negative affect stage. The negative emotional state of withdrawal may engage the activation of the extended amygdala. The extended amygdala is composed of several basal forebrain structures, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, and possibly a transition zone in the medial portion (or shell) of the nucleus accumbens. Major neurotransmitters in the extended amygdala hypothesized to have a function in negative reinforcement are corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, and dynorphin. Major projections of the extended amygdala are to the hypothalamus and brainstem. (c) Preoccupation/anticipation (craving) stage. This stage involves the processing of conditioned reinforcement in the BLA and the processing of contextual information by the hippocampus. Executive control depends on the prefrontal cortex and includes representation of contingencies, representation of outcomes, and their value and subjective states (ie, craving and, presumably, feelings) associated with drugs. The subjective effects termed drug craving in humans involve activation in functional imaging studies of the orbital and anterior cingulate cortices and temporal lobe, including the amygdala. A major neurotransmitter involved in the craving stage is glutamate localized in pathways from frontal regions and the BLA that project to the ventral striatum.

Although often linked to the construct of craving, craving per se has been difficult to measure clinically (Tiffany et al, 2000) and often does not correlate well with relapse. Nevertheless, the stage of the addiction cycle in which the individual reinstates drugseeking behavior after abstinence remains a challenging focus for neurobiological mechanisms and medications development for treatment. Animal models of craving can be divided into two domains: drug-seeking induced by drug or stimuli paired with drug-taking, and drug-seeking induced by an acute stressor or a residual negative emotional state, often a state of stress, termed protracted abstinence (see Transition to addiction: patterns of drugtaking, animal models section).

Neurocircuitry changes associated with drug- and cue-induced reinstatement after extinction have been linked to a glutamatergic pathway from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens core, the dopamine projection from the VTA to the medial prefrontal cortex, and the GABA projection from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum (Kalivas and O’Brien, 2008).

Parallel animal studies of the orbitofrontal, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus in addiction using animal models have begun to show some of the deficits reflected in human studies. Experimenter-administered cocaine produced impairments in reversal learning (an orbital frontal task) in rats and monkeys (Jentsch et al, 2002; Schoenbaum et al, 2004; Calu et al, 2007). Perhaps even more compelling, animals allowed extended access, but not limited access, to cocaine showed deficits in working memory (a prefrontal-cortex-dependent task), sustained attention task (a prefrontal-cortex-dependent task), and an object recognition task (a hippocampusdependent task; Briand et al, 2008a, b; George et al, 2008). In one study (Briand et al, 2008a), these deficits were associated with a significant decrease in dopamine $\\mathrm { D } _ { 2 }$ receptor mRNA in the medial and orbital prefrontal cortices, an observation also consistent with human imaging studies.

However, drug experimentation also results from the reinforcing effects of conforming to social groups (peer pressure) with the eventual subsequent transfer of motivation to taking the drug for its reinforcing effects. Infrequently, the first use of a drug may be related to its therapeutic properties (such as opiate analgesics for pain or stimulants for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). As shown by preclinical studies, a key element of the reinforcing effects of drugs is broadly accepted to involve their ability to trigger large increases in extracellular dopamine in limbic regions (including the nucleus accumbens). Although acute drug self-administration is a good animal model for drug intoxication, using animal models to assess the subjective correlates of drug-induced dopamine increases is difficult. Brain imaging studies in humans have been instrumental in showing that drug-induced increases in dopamine in the striatum (including the ventral striatum where the nucleus accumbens is located) are associated with subjective descriptors of reward (eg, pleasure, high, euphoria; Volkow et al, 1996b). Moreover, these studies have shown that fast dopamine changes are associated with the subjective perception of reward, whereas slow and stable dopamine increases do not induce these subjective responses (Grace, 2000; Volkow and Swanson, 2003).

For example, comparison of the brain pharmacokinetics of cocaine and of methamphetamine reveals that both reach the brain very rapidly (although cocaine is somewhat faster than methamphetamine) but that cocaine clears out of the brain much faster than methamphetamine (Figure 3). This difference helps explain why cocaine is taken every $3 0 { - } 6 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ during a binge, whereas methamphetamine is taken every couple of hours (Fowler et al, 2008). The importance of pharmacokinetics also helps explain why most abused drugs (with the exception of alcohol) are injected, smoked, or snorted. These routes allow for a much faster delivery of the drug to the brain than when taken orally (Volkow et al, 2000). Pharmacokinetics also help explain why stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate or amphetamine, which also increase dopamine, are not typically perceived as reinforcing when taken orally as prescribed therapeutically (Chait, 1994; Volkow et al, 2001b).

The dependency of the drug’s rewarding effects on context and expectation suggests the importance of other neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which modulates the reactivity of dopamine cells and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse (Kalivas and Volkow, 2005).

For some drugs such as opiates, alcohol, and sedative hypnotics, drug discontinuation in chronic drug users can trigger an intense, acute physical withdrawal syndrome that, if not properly managed and when severe, can sometimes be fatal. All drugs of abuse are associated with a motivational withdrawal syndrome characterized by dysphoria, irritability, emotional distress, and sleep disturbances that persist even after protracted withdrawal. The neurobiology of acute withdrawal is distinct from protracted or motivational withdrawal, and both contribute to relapse. Few imaging studies have been carried out during acute withdrawal. One such study that measured changes in dopamine during heroin withdrawal failed to document the dopamine decreases in the nucleus accumbens that had previously been reported with microdialysis in the rodent brain (Wang et al, 1997). From this study, it is unclear whether the results reflect the lack of involvement of striatal dopamine during acute withdrawal in heroin abusers or the limited sensitivity of the positron emission tomography (PET) technology.

Indeed, stress is a powerful trigger of relapse to drug-taking behaviors through the activation of brain circuits involved in reward processing and in the attentional and mnemonic bias for drug use reminders (Duncan et al, 2007). This chronic relapse phenomenon is broadly recognized as one of the most challenging problems in fighting drug addiction. Addicted subjects are liable to return to compulsive drug-taking long after experiencing acute withdrawal symptoms (Langleben et al, 2008). The gradual reorganization of reward and memory circuits, brought about by chronic drug abuse, is hypothesized to be crucial to the mounting of these responses. Both dopamine and glutamate have been identified in preclinical studies as contributing to the neuroplastic changes associated with conditioned responses. Moreover, plastic changes in CRF and glucocorticoid receptors likely participate in the enhanced sensitivity to stressors. In humans, the lack of suitable radiotracers to assess glutamate neurotransmission and the lack of ligands for CRF or glucocorticoid receptors have limited the studies of craving mostly to the dopamine system.

Such studies have revealed a rich neuroplasticity associated with mesolimbic dopamine systems and its terminal projection to the ventral striatum (where the nucleus accumbens is located). Drugs of abuse induce short- and long-term modifications of firing of dopamine neurons in the VTA (Bonci et al, 2003). Studies have shown that burst firing of dopamine neurons in the VTA appears to be correlated with an orienting response to a sensory stimulus (Freeman et al, 1985). A single in vivo exposure to cocaine or amphetamine induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA-mediated excitatory neurotransmission in dopamine neurons (Ungless et al, 2001). The potentiation of synaptic AMPA responses has been hypothesized to increase the incidence of burst firing (Jones and Bonci, 2005). Persistent LTP lasting for 3 months of abstinence was induced in the VTA in rats that actively self-administered cocaine but not in passively injected rats (Chen et al, 2008). Similar effects of induction of LTP of glutamate transmission on dopamine neurons have been observed with morphine and nicotine (Saal et al, 2003). ",

Schematic drawing describing the sequential and cumulative effects of neuroadaptive changes hypothesized to contribute to the neuroplasticity that promotes compulsive drug-seeking. An early neuroadaptation, common to all drugs of abuse and observed after a single injection of cocaine, is increased excitability of the mesolimbic dopamine system reflected in long-term potentiation dependent on changes in glutamate activity. Subsequently, the activation of dopamine contributes to increased excitability of the ventral striatum with decreased glutamatergic activity during withdrawal and increased glutamatergic activity during drug-primed and cue-induced drug-seeking. The engagement of ventral striatal-pallidal-thalamic loops is hypothesized to translate to the dorsal striatum to contribute to engagement of habits and automaticity that resemble compulsive-like behavior. As compulsivity evolves into fullblown addiction, loss of function occurs in the frontal cortex systems that control executive function, contributing to poor decision-making and gain of function in the brain stress systems but contributing to incentive salience for drugs over natural reinforcers.

Repeated cocaine administration increases glutamate neurotransmission only in rats that showed behavioral sensitization (Pierce et al, 1996). In addition, cocainesensitized mice showed an enhancement of LTP in nucleus accumbens slices during withdrawal, presumably reflecting increased activity of glutamatergic activity (Yao et al, 2004). An increased surface-to-intracellular ratio of glutamate-1 receptors (GluR1) has been observed 21 days after the last injection of cocaine, suggesting a slowly developing redistribution of AMPA receptors to the surface of nucleus accumbens neurons, particularly in those lacking GluR2 (Boudreau and Wolf, 2005; Conrad et al, 2008). The increases in cell-surface AMPA receptors depends on activation of dopamine $\\mathrm { D } _ { 1 }$ receptors and subsequent protein kinase A signaling (Chao et al, 2002). Functionally, overexpression of GluR1 in the nucleus accumbens facilitated extinction of cocaine-seeking responses (Sutton et al, 2003) and increased brain stimulation reward thresholds, reflecting decreased reward and possibly decreased motivated behavior (Todtenkopf et al, 2006). However, a single reexposure to cocaine during extended withdrawal produced synaptic depression, which may reflect the enhanced glutamate release during cocaine reexposure (Kourrich et al, 2007). Curiously, the increase in AMPA receptor expression observed with cocaine does not occur in amphetamine-sensitized rats, leading to the hypothesis of different functional effects of glutamate projections to the nucleus accumbens during cocaine vs amphetamine withdrawal (Nelson et al, 2009).

Thus, the hypothesis is that drug addiction represents changes in associative structures to become automatic or habitual and involves a gradual engagement of dorsal striatal mechanisms. ",

The cingulate gyrus is also involved and is a brain region implicated in inhibitory control and conflict resolution, disruption of which results in impulsivity (Volkow et al, 2004b). Moreover, in cocaine-addicted, but not nonaddicted, subjects, the intravenous administration of methylphenidate, which cocaine abusers report has effects similar to those of cocaine, activated the orbital and medial prefrontal cortices, and this activation was associated with cocaine craving (Volkow et al, 2005). Similarly, in marijuana-addicted subjects, but not in nonaddicted individuals, acute administration of $\\Delta ^ { 9 }$ -THC activated the obitofrontal cortex (Volkow et al, 1996a). Activation of the obitofrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus is also triggered by conditioned cues that predict reward and trigger craving (McClernon et al, 2009). Interestingly, these are regions that regulate dopamine cell firing and release, which have been postulated to be necessary for the enhanced incentive motivational values of drugs in addicted individuals (mirroring a hypothesis based on animal studies; Volkow et al, 1999). When combined, these observations strongly suggest that the dopamine increases associated with conditioned cues are not primary responses, but rather the result of feedback stimulation of dopamine cells, most likely glutamatergic afferents from the prefrontal cortex and/or amygdala. On the basis of these findings, the activation of the obitofrontal cortex, with concomitant increases in dopamine produced by the drug, has been hypothesized to contribute to the compulsive drug consumption that characterizes drug bingeing in addicted individuals (Volkow et al, 2007).

However, because of its integrative function in the regulation of arousal and attentional modulation, this region has been increasingly implicated in the addiction process. For example, intravenous administration of a stimulant drug in cocaine abusers, but not in controls, increased dopamine neurotransmission in the thalamus, an effect associated with craving (Volkow et al, 1997a). In contrast, compared with controls, cocaine abusers show hypoactivation of the thalamus, possibly reflecting noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic deficits, when performing a cognitive task (Tomasi et al, 2007b). Similarly, the thalamus was reported to show attenuated activation while performing a visual cognitive task in smokers exposed to nicotine (Sharma and Brody, 2009). These results suggest that thalamic abnormalities in cocaine abusers may contribute not only to impairments in sensory processing and attention but also to craving. Interestingly, changes in dopamine transmission in the thalamus and striatum appear to be involved in the deterioration of cognitive performance (eg, visual attention and working memory) that inexorably follows a period of sleep deprivation (Volkow et al, 2008b). Thus, more research that builds upon the available preliminary data is warranted. ",

Damage to the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus was shown to affect cocaine self-administration in rats (Caine et al, 2001). Such observations have provided insights into the possible involvement of a dysregulated hippocampus in human addiction. This hypothesis is an extension of current knowledge because the hippocampus is broadly viewed as important in contextual conditioning, namely in the processing of contextual cues by which memories can be accessed and retrieved. In fact, declarative memory has been long recognized to be involved in learning and the linking of affective conditions or circumstances with drugtaking experiences. Studies with PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging have shown that cue-elicited craving, as well as acute intoxication, activates the hippocampus and amygdala (Volkow et al, 2004a). For example, the craving that cocaine users experience while exposed to drug-related stimuli is accompanied by blood flow increases in a distributed region implicated in several forms of memory, including the amygdala (Childress et al, 1999; Grant et al, 1996; Kilts et al, 2001) and hippocampus (Kilts et al, 2001).

        "text": "The focus of the present review is on the neurocircuitry of addiction. However, parallel to the neuroplasticity of the neurocircuitry are the molecular changes that occur in these same structures. Chronic exposure to opiates and cocaine leads to activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens and CeA (Shaw-Lutchman et al, 2002; Edwards et al, 2007). CREB can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and by protein kinase regulated by growth factors, putting it at a point of convergence for several intracellular messenger pathways that can regulate gene expression. Activation of CREB in the nucleus accumbens with psychostimulant drugs is linked to the motivational symptoms of psychostimulant withdrawal, such as dysphoria, possibly through induction of the opioid peptide dynorphin, which binds to $\\kappa$ -opioid receptors and has been hypothesized to represent a mechanism of motivational tolerance and dependence (Nestler, 2005). Repeated CREB activation promotes dynorphin expression in the nucleus accumbens, which in turn decreases dopaminergic activity, both of which can contribute to negative emotional states. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase is another key element of intracellular signaling considered a key component in the plasticity associated with repeated administration of cocaine, specifically behavioral sensitization, cocaine reward, and time-dependent increases in cocaine-seeking after withdrawal (ie, incubation effect; Lu et al, 2006; Li et al, 2008).

Here, repeated administration of cocaine blunts cystine–glutamate exchange, leading to reduced basal and increased cocaine-induced glutamate in the nucleus accumbens that persists for at least 3 weeks after the last cocaine treatment (Baker et al, 2003). Most compelling is the observation that treatment with $N \\cdot$ -acetylcysteine, by activating cystine–glutamate exchange, prevented cocaineinduced escalation and behavioral sensitization, restored the ability to induce LTP and long-term depression in the nucleus accumbens, and blunted reinstatement in animals and conditioned reactivity to drug cues in humans (Moussawi et al, 2009; LaRowe et al, 2007; Madayag et al, 2007).

Although acute administration of drugs of abuse can cause a rapid (within hours) activation of members of the Fos protein family, such as c-fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 in the nucleus accumbens, other transcription factors, isoforms of DFosB, a highly stable form of FosB, have been shown to accumulate over longer periods of time (days) with repeated drug administration (Nestler, 2005). Animals with activated DFosB have exaggerated sensitivity to the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, and DFosB may be a sustained molecular ‘switch’ that helps to initiate and maintain a state of addiction (McClung et al, 2004). Whether (and how) such transcription factors influence the function of the brain stress systems, such as CRF and those described above, remains to be determined. ",

        "text": "In summary, multiple brain regions and circuits are disrupted in drug addiction and are likely to contribute differentially to the complex phenotype observed in addicted individuals (Figure 5). Although some of these functional abnormalities may be present to a greater or lesser extent across all classes of drug addictions, some of the changes may be specific to certain types of drugs. For example, long-lasting decrements in the DAT in the striatum are observed in methamphetamine but not in alcohol or cocaine addictions. Conversely, decrements in dopamine $\\mathrm { D } _ { 2 }$ receptors in the striatum are observed in subjects addicted to all of the drugs of abuse that have been investigated, and increased activation of brain stress systems such as CRF has been observed in animal models during acute withdrawal for all types of drugs. Importantly, the neuronal abnormalities that become manifest in an addicted individual and that can be uncovered by imaging and/or neuropsychopharmacological studies are a reflection of not only a given chronic drug exposure trajectory, but also an individual’s specific constellations of genetic, developmental, and environmental characteristics.

For example, what is the relationship between vulnerability to impulsivity and subsequent compulsivity in the neuroplasticity of the circuits described above?
