The worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer’s Dementia (Alzheimer’s Disease) (AD) has been estimated to be 24 millions in 2005 and predicted to increase by as much as four-fold by the year 2050 ( 1). With regard to the incidence and prevalence of AD, North America and Western Europe rank the highest, followed closely by Latin America and China. AD has a projected worldwide incidence of more than 30 million by 2040 ( 2). The fiscal impact on the resources of health care and the public health is substantial. Vigorous evidence in support of strategies to delay, prevent and to modify the course of AD is lacking.

Successful cognitive aging consists of developing and implementing proactive health strategies to boost “cognitive reserve” and consolidate “cognitive maintenance” ( 3 ).  In cognitive aging, there has been growing interest in the crucial role of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), coupled with the intracellular second messengers: cAMP and cGMP , in regulating multiple gene expressions ( 4).  Both cAMP and cGMP  signal cascades are involved in diverse neurobiological events directly relevant to cognitive aging: neuronal survival, apoptosis, synaptic strength , synaptic plasticity and neural connectivity. In this respect the superfamily of 11 phosphodiesterases (PDE) widely distributed in the mammalian brain function regulate and fine-tune the homeostasis of cAMP-cGMP via sensing the intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides ( 5 ). There are 11 members of PDE- family: PDE-1, PDE-2, PDE-3, PDE-4, PDE-5, PDE-6, PDE-7, PDE-8, PDE-9, PDE-10 and PDE-11 with their characteristic substratespecificities, tissue distribution and physiological functions. The PDE family has a total of 21 isoforms with multiple gene splice variants  that encode more than 50 proteins expressed in mammalian cells. Differential changes in PDE expression were found. There is a growing body of evidence in support of the differential roles of PDE-2, PDE-4, PDE-5 and PDE-10 in modulating multiple cognitive processes in aging.  Recently, selectivity of PDE isoforms for cGMP vs cAMP has  been well characterized delineated in vitro and in vivo ",

The second messengers:  cAMP and cGMP are both implicated in Alzheimer Disease (AD) , evidence is mounting that cAMP/Phosphokinase-A (PKA) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the production of neurofibrillary tangles via tau phosphorylation ( 7,8, 9 ).  Dysregulation of adenylate cyclase (AC)/cAMP/PKA signaling results in aberrant activation of CREB ,eading to loss of synaptic plasticity and memory decline.  This model highlights synaptic loss in AD.  A number of studies find evidence for altered mRNAs linked to cAMP-specific PDEs in postmortem human brains (review 10).  Up-regulation of PDE4a, PDE4b and PDE7a expression was fund in the early stages of AD, whereas increased PDE8-b expression was found in the entorhinal cortex of advanced AD brain samples. Loss of oligodendrocytes as measured with the reduced cAMP-specific PDE7a mRNA in the white matter nerve tracts was also reported.  In the hippocampus of AD, reduced expression of PDE4D isoforms :3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 was found, whereas a robust signal was found for the upregulation of the predominant short form of PDE4D. Selectivity of PDE for cGMP vs cAMP has been well delineated in in vitro and in vivo systems. On the other hand, changes in PDE isoforms:PDD-4, PDE-5 and PDE-9 highlight the emerging role of cGMP/nitric oxide (NO) signaling in cognition and aging (11). Taken together, the studies strongly suggest that selective dysregulation of PDE-mediated cAMP/PKA/CREB cellular signaling is linked closely to  AD progression and severity. ",

In the PDE-4D knockout rat,working memory measure was increased and mediated through hippocampal neurogenesis . Mice deficient for PDE4b exhibit enhanced long term depression (LTD) without affecting the LTP On the other hand, mice deficient in PDE4d show enhanced LTP efficacy without any effects on LTD.  The results suggest that both LTP and LTD are mediated through PDE4 subtypes inactivation.

Nutrients offer unique template for PDE4-cAMP-CREB signal cascade. Caffeine (1, 3, 5-trimethylxanthine) in targeting both PDE-4 and PDE-5, as well as functioning as adenosine-2 receptor antagonist, has recently been reported to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia (19,20). In the prospective Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study, daily coffee drinking totaling 3-5 cups per day at midlife reduced the risk of Alzheimer dementia (AD) by about 65% at late-life (21 ). High blood levels of caffeine prevented  the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to early stage of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) (22 ).  Achieving the critical blood level of 1200 ng/ml 30 minutes following oral intake of 200 mg caffeine tablets appears to protect MCI from converting to early AD . Plasma caffeine levels greater than 1200 ng/ml (≈6 μM) in MCI subjects were associated with no conversion to dementia during the ensuing 2-4 year follow-up period.  Recently a great deal of excitement has been generated with the isolation of resveratrol from grapes AA in the context of cognitive aging (23).Apart from the neuroprotection , resveratrol isolated from grapes may likely reprogram aging through telomere shortening, altering the amyloid protein misfolding and restoring mitochondria bioenergetics. It is likely that the neuroprotective activities are mediated through PDE-4-cAMP signaling ( 24 ). ",

Shifting the equilibrium between the catalytic activities of HDAC (histone deacetylase) and HAT (histone acetyltransferase) towards hyper-acetylation may play an important role in AD ( 28 ).

Activation of serotonin receptor type-4 upregulates alpha-secretase which in turn reduces the amyloid load,  and improves cognitive deficits ( 51 ). In transgenic mice, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated as anti-depressants for major depression (citaloprim, fluoxetine) reduced amyloid plaques  (52). Two independent studies showed that clinical subjects exposed to SSRI showed similar reduction in amyloid-beta load as quantified with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging  and CSF Aβ ( 53, 52).

In the early days of the colonists in South Africa, chewing of the plant was documented as early as l868 . The bioactive alkaloid composition of Sceletium tortuosum is very complex. Post-harvesting fermentation can alter the total alkaloid composition of Sceletium tortuosium (73 ).  The acqueous-ethanolic extracts of the plant have recently been fully characterized utilizing cutting-edge analytical medicinal chemistry techniques.  The standardized 2:1 dry aqueous-ethanolic extract of Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E.:Zembrin extract, manufactured according to European Union Good Manufacturing practice (GMP) belongs to the botanical family Mesembryathemaceaecontaining a total alkaloid content of not less than 0.38 % by weight (74, 75 ). The relative amounts of the four key mesembraine-alkaloids(Figure 2) are accurately and reproducibly quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis against externally validated analytical reference compounds.  The final Zembrin extract product appears as a fine dry powder with the dry plant material : extract in the ratio of 2:1 and conforms to  the composition profile: mesembrenone + mesembrenol : > 70%; and mesembrine < 20 %.

We will use the NIA-AA criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment:MCI. MCI diagnosis requires identifying intra-individual cognitive decline and function and cognitive impairment in at least one cognitive domain. MCI distinguishes from formal AD phase in that in MCI, the individual maintains relative independence in functional abilities ( 77). Brain imaging studies show that the culprit of AD, Abeta amyloid , can be localized in the asymptomatic clients for over 10 years prior to the onset of AD ( 78).  Hence the asymptomatic phase offers a unique therapeutic window for pro-active interventions to prevent or to delay the onset of AD.

In the PDE assay system using the human recombinant PDE-4B and PDE-4D expressed   in SF9 cells, the extract Selenium tortuous (Zembrin®)  selectively inhibited phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) with IC50 (inhibitory constant) value of 8.5 μg/ml. Structure-activity analysis shows that  mesembreonone is the most potent compound in inhibiting PDE-4B. In the recombinant PDE4 in vitro assay,  Mesembrenone, a major alkaloid isolated from the extract ( Figure 1) was active in inhibiting PDE4 with an IC50 value of  < 1μM. Mesembrenone was 17 times more potent than mesembrine and 34 times more active than mesembenol in competing for PDE-4 binding. When expressed in terms of the drug potency index,  the IC50 values for mesembrenone was 470 nM, followed by mesembrine,: 7800 nM and mesembrenol : 10,000 nM.  At the molecular level, the pharmacological effects of Zembrin and the mesembrine alkaloids are mediated via the long arm of  isoform of PDE-4D3. Higher concentrations of the extract Selenium tortuous (Zembrin®) exhibit some activities at the GABA receptor, mu (μ) and  delta(δ2 ) opioid receptors, cholecystokinin-1 , EP4  prostaglandin, and melatonin-1 receptors, but the functional significance is less than that of PDE-4 and 5-HT uptake sites. PDE-4 interaction with Zembrin is selective for PDE-4 since the standardized Zembrin extract and mesembrane related alkaloids exhibited little effects on  PDE-1,PDE-2, PDE-3, PDE-5, PDE-6, PDE-7 PDE-8 , PDE-10 and PDE-11a. We are fully aware that roflumilast (Daliresp, Forest Pharmaceuticals) is FDA approved as  is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor targeting specifically the inflammatory cells involved in triggering chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ) exacerbation.  Whether Zembrin behaves similarly towards pulmonary inflammatory cells in vitro and in vivo, remains uncertain. Two clinical studies of Zembrin in normal subjects do not find any adverse effects on the respiratory system (101,103). Mesembrine alkaloids are distinguished from classical PDE-4 inhibitors in displaying concomitant serotonergic activity. Mesembrine was found to be the most potent compound in binding to the serotonin transporter site (5-HT site) with Hill coefficient of 1.4 nM. Mesembrenone and mesembranol are less potent in competing for the 5-HT transport site in vitro ",
