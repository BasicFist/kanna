        "text": "Southern Africa is an important focal point of botanical and cultural diversity but only a few plant species have hitherto become fully commercialised as medicinal products. In recent years there has been an upsurge in research and development activity, resulting in several new products and new crops. In this review, more than 90 of the best-known and most promising indigenous South African plants are listed and subjectively evaluated in the context of their potential for commercialisation as medicinal products for a variety of applications. The history of product development relating to the following species is briefly discussed and the plants and some of their products are illustrated: Agathosma betulina (buchu), Aloe ferox (bitter aloe), Artemisia afra (African wormwood), Aspalathus linearis (rooibos tea), Bulbine frutescens (burn jelly plant); Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush tea), Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), Hoodia gordonii (hoodia, ghaap), Hypoxis hemerocallidea (“African potato”), Lippia javanica (fever tea), Mesembryanthemum tortuosum $\\stackrel {  } { = }$ Sceletium tortuosum) (kanna, kougoed), Pelargonium sidoides (“Umckaloabo”), Siphonochilus aethiopicus (African ginger), Sutherlandia frutescens $\\left( = \\right.$ Lessertia frutescens) (cancer bush), Warburgia salutaris (pepperbark tree) and Xysmalobium undulatum (“Uzara”). The main factors that are apparently responsible for failure or success will be highlighted, especially the importance of marketing strategy, proof of concept and barriers to market entry. ",

        "text": "The first systematic account of the medicinal plants of South Africa were published by Pappe (1847, 1850, 1854, 1857, 1862, 1868), who described all the most important traditional herbal medicines known at the time. The Flora Capensis (a colonial flora) started by Harvey and Sonder (1860, 1862, 1864) included anecdotal information about the medicinal uses of several species and was probably intended as a plant use catalogue to facilitate the British imperial trade in plant products. A historically important book on medicinal plants is that of Smith (1888, revised in 1895) which provides insight into the most popular traditional medicine of the Eastern Cape region at that time. The Flora of South Africa published in six volumes by Marloth (1913–1932) also included information about commercially relevant plants. Marloth was a trained pharmacist with a special interest in medicinal plants. An important milestone in the documentation of medicinal plants was the detailed and comprehensive work of Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), “The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa”, which is still regularly cited in scientific publications. Van Wyk et al. (1997) further conceptualised and popularised the field of medicinal plants in South Africa with the book entitled “Medicinal Plants of South Africa”, which included short scientific monographs of 132 of the most popular and widely used medicinal plants. An updated and expanded edition, now including 150 monographs, is available (Van Wyk et al., 2009). Van Wyk and Gericke (2000) presented detailed information on a large number of medicinal plants in Part 2 of the book “People's Plants”, which includes chapters on general medicines, tonic plants, mind and mood plants, women's health, wounds, burns and skin conditions, dental care, perfumes and repellents, and soaps and cosmetics. A comprehensive list of southern African medicinal plants (with literature references) is that of Arnold et al. (2002). Several other books provided valuable information on a regional level, especially those on Zulu medicinal plants by Hutchings et al. (1996), useful Namibian plants by Von Koenen (2001) and Sotho medicinal plants by Moffett (2010). Especially relevant in the context of new product development is the book edited by Diederichs (2006), entitled “Commercialising medicinal plants. A South African guide”. The various chapters cover many aspects of research and development, including sustainable harvesting, conservation, trade regulations, economics, propagation, cultivation, chemistry and pharmacology, processing and packaging, marketing, business development and benefitsharing.

        "text": "The indigenous biological resources of Africa and the commercialisation of plants in Africa were reviewed by Geldenhuys and Van Wyk (2002) and Okole and Odhav (2002). According to the “African Plant Checklist and Database Project” (Klopper et al., 2006), 50 136 angiosperm taxa occur in Africa south of the Sahara (32 424 taxa in tropical Africa and 22 755 taxa in southern Africa). The last two numbers add up to 55179 but the discrepancy is due to different taxonomic treatments in the two regions. This diversity represents perhaps 20 to $2 5 \\%$ of the global total. The potential commercial importance of this resource can be judged by the comprehensive list of African medicinal plants (Neuwinger, 2000), where more than 5 400 medicinal plant taxa and over 16 300 medicinal uses are listed. This means that $1 0 . 8 \\%$ of the African flora is known to be used in traditional medicine. The corresponding statistic for southern Africa is an estimated 3 000 species or $1 3 . 8 \\%$ of the flora (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000) or the more exact count of 2 942 species (administered to humans), representing $1 3 . 5 \\%$ of the flora, presented by Arnold et al. (2002). These figures are based on an angiosperm species count of 21 817 for southern Africa (Germishuizen and Meyer, 2003). The global review of commercialised medicinal plants by Van Wyk and Wink (2004) indicated that 83 African medicinal plants have been commercialised (as branded products) and that at best only 14 southern African species can be considered to be partially or fully commercialised compared to 336 species in Europe, for example. The most valuable of all medicinal plants may well be Aloe vera L. (of North African or perhaps Arabian origin) — fresh Aloe vera gel products had an annual retail value of approximately US\\$ 125 million in 2004 (Afolayan and Adebola, 2006). ",

It has been estimated by Mander (1998) that the total volume of medicinal products traded annually in South Africa may exceed 20 000 tonnes, with a turnover of approximately US\\$ 60 million per year. There is a general trend to develop and brand these traditional products so that they resemble more closely those consumer products that are sold as over-the-counter medicines and herbal supplements.

These products are well known in the international trade and most of them have a long track record of exports to European countries.   \n(2) Bioprospecting phase. This phase involves the largescale, ethnobotanically-guided screening of species to identify plants with commercial potential. This phase started in the early 1960s, with the companies Noristan and Smith-Kline Beecham, in collaboration with organic chemists from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and botanists from the National Botanical Institute (National Herbarium) in Pretoria, as the main role players. During this time a project on edible plants was started at the National Food Research Institute of the CSIR, which included the first work on Hoodia species (Maharaj, 2009). When the Noristan project was terminated, a large data base with confidential research results was transferred to the University of Cape Town. A bioprospecting project was started at the CSIR in 1993 and is still ongoing. More recently, there has been several multi-institutional projects (involving the South African National Biodiversity Institute and South African Universities) to explore the commercial potential of medicinal plants. Numerous scientific discoveries were made during this phase, including the isolation of monatin (a sweetener) from Sclerochiton ilicifolius (Vleggaar et al., 1992) and the discovery of P57 (an appetite suppressant) in $H .$ gordonii (Van Heerden et al., 1998). Pioneering work on $H .$ hemerocallidea also dates from this period, including the very first clinical study on an indigenous medicinal plant. The commercial history of Hypoxis (and subsequent “immune system boosters” derived from it) was reviewed by Drewes et al. (2008). ",

This phase started in the mid 1990s with research and development aimed at producing branded health care products from well-known and widely used indigenous medicinal plants. A feature of this phase was the development of several new crops, based on the consideration that large-scale commercial development may not be sustainable if the raw materials are taken from nature. The projects and products were not based on the results of bioprospecting, but focused on the most popular South African traditional medicines that were already widely traded in informal markets or extensively used as traditional household remedies. The health benefits of the plant species were already in the public domain for a long time (in most cases for at least a century). The logic of this approach is clear — why look for “new” products when the best ones have already been identified through centuries of trial and error?

Amongst the earliest products were L. javanica and L. scaberrima herbal teas produced by the Veld Foods initiative in Botswana (ca. 1995) and the Healer's Choice range of branded products developed by South African Druggists (now incorporated into Aspen Pharmacare) in 1995 and 1996, which included a tincture made from low-thujone clones of Artemisa afra. The first research and development of M. tortuosum $\\left[ = \\right.$ Sceletium tortuosum) also occurred during this period (Gericke and Van Wyk, 1997). The branded tinctures produced in the SA Druggists era served as role models and numerous similar tinctures (small and large scale) are now available. Another noteworthy effort to produce new crops and new herbal health care products is that of the company Phyto Nova (Pty) Ltd, responsible for the first branded products developed from $M .$ tortuosum, S. aethiopicus, S. frutescens and W. salutaris. The lastmentioned was the origin of the concept of plant part replacement, i.e. the replacement of bark with chemically similar leaves, as a conservation measure. These products were developed as tablets and some are still available under the Phyto Nova Natural Medicines brand (a new name given to the company when it was taken over by Thebe Medicare in 2005). Some of the prototypes and first branded products developed by Phyto Nova are shown in Fig. 1. This phase has seen an unprecedented increase in the number of scientific publications and citations in patents (details are given in Van Wyk, 2008a and Makunga et al., 2008). A scopus search on 25 April 2008 showed that the number of citations in publications of the above-mentioned 16 commercial species increased from a total of $1 0 2 ~ \\mathrm { u p }$ to the year 1995, to 469 in the period 1996 to 2005, whilst the number of citations in patents rose from 72 to 438 in the corresponding periods (data from Table 1 in Van Wyk, 2008a).

The implications of benefit sharing in practice have been discussed by several authors in the book edited by Denzil Phillips International (2009). Whilst the aims of the Act are laudable, the implementation of the regulations is impractical and may inadvertently discourage rather than encourage innovation in this potentially important sector of the economy.

        "text": "Round leaf buchu is endemic to the Cederburg region of South Africa and is an important plant in the Khoi-San tradition. It has been wild-harvested at least since 1820 and cultivated since the 1970s or perhaps even earlier (Fig. 1, 1A). Recent efforts in crop development have resulted in buchu now being a viable option for small-scale farming (although producer prices have fluctuated wildly in recent years). Recently growers experienced severe losses, ascribed to a soilborne disease (Bezuidenhout et al., 2010). Tinctures of buchu (“buchu brandy”, Fig. 1, 1D and medicinal products, Fig. 1, 1E) have a great reputation as general health tonics, stomachics, aromatic bitters, diuretics and mild urinary antiseptics (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). The major volatile compounds of round leaf buchu are isomenthone and diosphenol (Kaiser et al., 1975; Posthumus et al., 1996; Collins et al., 1996; Moolla and Viljoen, 2008), which are not only responsible for the distinctive flavour (not unlike cassis) but probably also for antispasmodic, antiseptic and diuretic activities (Wichtl and Bisset, 2000, Lis-Balchin et al., 2001; Moolla and Viljoen, 2008). The closely related oval leaf buchu (A. crenulata), as well as hybrids between the two species, are less desirable due to high levels of pulegone, a potentially harmful substance. ",

        "text": "A. ferox has a very long history of use in southern Africa, as is evidenced by a San rock painting (Reynolds 1950) depicting humans interacting with aloes. At current levels of demand, wild-crafting can be done without serious damage to natural populations (Newton and Vaughan, 1996). The first A. ferox plantation (6 ha) was established by Dr Tewis Muller on the farm Vinklaagte near Albertinia in 1976 (Fig. 1, 2A). Several other plantations have recently been established (e.g. 19 ha on the farm Tierfontein near Albertinia, in February 2008). By growing the plants in rows on open flat terrain, the harvesting operation becomes more efficient (because of easy access to the plants by both people and vehicles) thus reducing overall production costs and allowing for irrigation (by tractor-drawn water carts) during droughts so as to ensure a steady supply of raw materials. The bitter yellow leaf exudate (Fig. 1, 2D) is tapped by stacking the cut leaves around a hollow in the ground (lined with an animal skin or nowadays plastic sheeting), allowing the liquid to collect in the hollow. The exudate is boiled on open fires to reduce the water content, so that it solidifies to form a dark brown or black, glass-like substance known as aloe lump or Cape aloes (Fig. 1, 2C). This laxative medicine has been exported to Europe since 1761 (Marloth, 1913–1932; Kruger and Beyers, 1977; Robertson, 1979). Aloin (syn. barbaloin), an anthrone- $C$ -glycoside, is the main laxative compound in aloe lump (Van Wyk et al., 1995). Annual exports in recent years amounted to ca. 350 tonnes (Knapp, 2006). The aloe lump is sold as is (Fig. 1, 2E) or tinctures containing aloe lump are used as traditional bitter tonics and stomachics (Fig. 1, 2F, 2G), reputed to also have anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory properties (Newall et al., 1996; Blumenthal et al., 1998; Wichtl and Bisset, 2000; ESCOP, 2003). Nowadays the non-bitter, leaf parenchyma gel, obtained as “jelly” through a patented process (O'Brien et al., in press) and used to produce gel drinks, is the most popular product for the local industry (Fig. 1, 2F). A wide range of cosmetics and skin care products are also based on A. ferox gel. Another potential use of the gel is as a pharmaceutical excipient in novel drug delivery systems from renewable sources (Fischer et al., 2000). The work of the Aloe Council of South Africa (a non-profit company founded in 2003) has led to the development of a South African national standard for aloe raw materials, published in 2007 (Standards South Africa, 2007). There are important differences between the gels of A. ferox and A. vera — the South African gel product has polysaccharides of the arabinogalactan and rhamnogalacturonan types and it lacks acetylated sugars (Mabusela et al., 1990; O'Brien et al., in press). The quality control criteria for A. vera gel are therefore not applicable to A. ferox. There are opportunities to develop new products for human and animal health care, not only from A. ferox but also from other species such as $A$ arborescens and A. marlothii. Grace et al. (2008, in press) provided reviews of the traditional uses of Aloe species in southern Africa. ",

The modest beginnings and early growth of the industry is described by Anonymous (1975), where mention is made of the first tea-makers of the Cederberg (of KhoiSan descent), the first commercialisation by Benjamin Ginsberg in 1904, the pioneering crop development efforts of Louis Leipoldt, P. le Fras Nortier and Oloff Bergh (and later also James Van Putten) and the background history of the establishment of the Rooibos Tea Control Board in 1954, as a single-channel marketing system to try and stabilise the wildly fluctuating supply and demand for rooibos tea.

The industry is rapidly growing as a result of crop development by De Lange (1997), as well as improved processing and pharmacological studies, as summarised by Joubert et al. (in press). Important basic scientific information was contributed by De Nysschen et al.

The history of research and development work on hoodia was reviewed by Maharaj (2009). The appetite-suppressant effect has been ascribed to a pregnane compound known as P57 (Van Heerden et al., 1998; Van Heerden, 2008) but there is as yet no published human clinical data to support the claim that hoodia products can safely suppress appetite. Despite the lack of scientific information on efficacy and appropriate therapeutic doses, hoodia products have become popular all over the world (Jayawardane, 2011). The agreement reached between the CSIR and the San community (Maharaj, 2009) is one of the first examples of compensation of a local community for the benefits derived from the commercialisation of indigenous knowledge.

Some in vitro evidence was published for the claimed immune-stimulant effects (Bouic et al., 1996). Extracts of the corms of Hypoxis (Fig. 1, 9D) are ingredients of an ever diversifying range of products used as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatories, anti-diabetics and anti-convulsants (Drewes et al., 2008; see also the review by Owira and Ojewole, 2009).

In a molecular systematic study (Klak et al., 2007), Sceletium and other genera were formally subsumed under the genus Mesembryanthemum. The uses and properties have been described by Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), Watt (1967), Smith et al.

It is interesting to note that the first experimental plantings (Fig. 1, 11A) were made in 1996, more than 300 years after Van der Stel (1685) first suggested that profit could be made from growing and trading with channa. The activity of the plant and the traditional product (Fig. 1, 11B–D) is ascribed to serotonin reuptake-inhibiting alkaloids, of which mesembrine is the main compound (Gericke and Van Wyk, 1997). The first tablets containing powdered whole plants were produced by Phyto Nova in 2000 (Fig. 1, 11E). A benefit-sharing agreement was recently signed between HGH Pharmaceuticals and the South African San Council, who in turn entered into an agreement with the Nama communities of Kamiesberg in Namaqualand to share financial benefits that may result from commercialisation. Research and development work is currently underway to create what may become an important and commercially successful herbal sedative for international markets. ",

These include asthma, cancer (prevention and treatment), chronic bronchitis, colds, cough, diabetes, dysentery, fever, gastritis, heartburn, heart failure, indigestion, influenza, kidney and liver ailments, oesophagitis, peptic ulcers, poor appetite, rheumatism, unspecified wasting diseases and urinary tract infections. It has received special attention because of anecdotes suggesting dramatic improvements in the quality of life in HIV/AIDS patients and a reduction in the muscle-wasting (cachexia) effect of AIDS. A safety study done by the Medical Research Council of South Africa (Seier et al., 2002) and a clinical (phase I) study (Johnson et al., 2007) showed no signs of toxicity or side effects.

The conservation and cultivation of W. salutaris were initiated by the company HL& H (now Mondi Forests), who started a living gene bank of about 3000 trees at their White River Nursery. Using expertise in the rooting of Eucalyptus cuttings, a large number of trees were propagated for distribution in 1996, when W. salutaris was chosen as South Africa's “Tree of the Year”.

        "text": "Scientific evidence to substantiate medicinal claims appears to be the most important limiting factor in the development of indigenous herbal products. Traditional uses may be a good starting point in product development but is unlikely to lead to sustainable commercial success in the long run. Examples that come to mind are $H .$ hemerocallidea, Aloe vera and $H .$ . gordonii. Hypoxis was the subject of numerous studies in the 1970s and formed the basis of a lucrative trade in so-called “immunestimulants” but as yet there is no convincing in vivo evidence published in peer-reviewed journals. Aloe gel health drinks are perhaps the best example of a major international herbal product that still lacks convincing clinical evidence of therapeutic benefits. The almost complete absence of published clinical studies is especially noteworthy when the enormous annual turnover of this industry is considered. (Perhaps no-one wants to spoil a good marketing story with inconvenient facts?). Weight loss products are often purely market-driven and Hoodia appears to be no exception. The lack of reliable published clinical evidence on the therapeutic dose and its efficacy as appetite suppressant does not seem to be regarded as a serious concern and there are still numerous Hoodia-containing products available on the international market.

        "text": "The main stimulus for marketing success of herbal products appears to be proof of concept in the form of human trials. The commercial success of two of the most famous and valuable indigenous species can be related to clinical evidence of efficacy in the form of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: H. procumbens became internationally known after the first clinical studies were conducted in France and Germany in the 1960s; $P$ . sidoides became the basis of a very lucrative over-thecounter medicine only after several clinical studies (summarised in Brendler and Van Wyk, 2008). The recent boom in the rooibos tea industry may at least partly be ascribed to a growing body of scientific evidence indicating important health benefits. Clinical evidence in the form of post-marketing surveillance or double-blind, placebo-controlled studies may pay healthy dividends in the long run, despite the large financial inputs required for this type of research. A good example is the marketing success achieved with P. sidoides. However, this depends on the product being developed. No company will spend a lot of money on clinical research to develop an anti-diarrhoeal as there are already many such products available. ",

The few indigenous plants that have become important commercial crops and products all have a very long history of crop and product development, with large amounts of money spent on marketing over many years. These include A. betulina (since 1820), A. ferox (since 1761), A. linearis (since 1904), $C .$ . genistoides (since 1847; branded since the 1960s), $H .$ procumbens (since ca. 1907), P. sidoides (since 1898) and $X .$ undulatum (since 1909). In 2002, it was estimated that the establishment of a new brand of herbal medicine in South Africa would cost at least R 12 million rands or ca. $\\in 1 . 2$ million (Louis Schutte, S.A. Natural Products, personal communication, 2002). Multilevel marketing, the backbone of the enormous Aloe vera industry in the USA, has in recent years proven to be a highly successful strategy in South Africa and may become increasingly important in response to a very competitive retail market. There is no doubt that opportunities still exist for market-driven development projects based on those indigenous medicinal plant species listed in Table 1. ",

There is an urgent need to encourage bioprospecting and new product development, to build local capacity in this field and to implement measures to counteract the negative perceptions and practical difficulties associated with restrictive new regulations. The development of a successful new product is a complicated process that requires hard work, technical skills, substantial investment and innovative marketing, sustained over long periods. The pioneers involved in this process often gain nothing except the satisfaction that they have created opportunities for the next generation of skillfull entrepreneurs to achieve market success. It is hoped that inspired and talented individuals will be allowed the freedom to maximise the opportunities presented by the rich diversity of the South African flora by developing innovative products in order to create new marketing opportunities in local and international markets, and to find new ways of generating wealth for the benefit of all.
