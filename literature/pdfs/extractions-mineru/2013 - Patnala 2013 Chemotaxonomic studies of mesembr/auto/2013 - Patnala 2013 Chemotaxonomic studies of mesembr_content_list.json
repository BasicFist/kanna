Furthermore, several different Sceletium species exist and little has been reported on the alkaloidal identities and contents of the various species. We therefore conducted phytochemical investigations on six selected Sceletium specimens, identified on the basis of their venation pattern as either ‘emarcidum’ or ‘tortuosum’ type. The tortuosum type consisted of S. tortuosum, S. expansum and S. strictum, whereas the emarcidum type consisted of S. emarcidum, S. exalatum and S. rigidum. Analysis was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV and alkaloids were identified by online mass spectroscopy. S. tortuosum and S. expansum samples contained mesembrine together with mesembrenone, mesembranol and epimesembranol, although the latter two alkaloids were present in low concentrations in S. expansum. S. strictum contained mesembrenone, mesembrine and either $4 '$ -O-demethylmesembrenone or $4 '$ -O-demethylmesembrenol. The emarcidum type specimens showed a complete absence of the major alkaloid mesembrine, as well as the other alkaloids usually associated with these species. In only one of the species of the emarcidum type – S. exalatum – two peaks corresponded to either 4’-O-demethylmesembrenone or $o$ -methyljoubertiamine and either $4 '$ -O-demethylmesembrenol or $\\mathsf { N }$ -demethylmesembrenol, respectively. This study clearly indicates that not all Sceletium species contain the mesembrine-type alkaloids usually associated with Sceletium. It is thus important to identify the correct Sceletium species to ensure correct alkaloidal content for the manufacture and quality control of products containing this plant material. ",

The market for herbal products is lucrative as a result of increased consumer interest in phyto-pharmaceutical therapies. As a consequence, commercial interest in herbal plant medicines and the production of their dosage forms is undergoing great expansion. Such expansion, however, is associated with increased concerns relating to the quality of such products. A standardised or constant composition of the relevant components in herbal preparations is an important requirement, both from a regulatory point of view as well as for the consumer.1 However, because of the multiplicity of endogenous compounds usually present in most plants, standardisation, identification and quality control of the contents of pharmacologically active components present in the plant are generally not achieved. The factors that affect the content of active constituents in herbal plants include the age of the plant, temperature, daylight exposure, atmosphere, sampling method, the presence of toxic residues in soil, rainfall, altitude, soil composition and microbial contamination.2 ",

Proper identification is thus necessary in order to cultivate the correct species of the medicinal plant which will yield the requisite compound or constituents which are pharmacologically active. ",

Some of the closely related alkaloidal structures, such as mesembrenone or $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone and the epimers mesembranol or epimesembranol have the same molecular weights but differ slightly in their chemical structure, such as the position of a double bond (mesembrenone or $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone) or configuration (mesembranol or epimesembranol). We have shown the identity, alkaloidal content and composition of various Sceletium plant species. The ‘tortuosum’-type Sceletium species contained specific alkaloids which differed in content and composition between species. S. tortuosum contained mesembrine as the major alkaloid along with other minor alkaloids, $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone, mesembrenone and mesembranol. Interestingly, the ‘emarcidum’-type specimens showed a complete absence of mesembrine as well as other alkaloids usually found in the tortuosum-type species. In only one of the species of the emarcidum type (S. exalatum), two peaks eluted at RTs of 5.09 min and 5.57 min whose $m / z$ ratios corresponded to either $4 '$ -O-demethyl-mesmbrenone or $o$ -methyl-joubertiamine $( \\mathsf { M } \\mathsf { N } \\mathsf { s } = 2 7 3 )$ and 4’-O-demethylmesembrenol or N-demethyl-mesembrenol (MWs ${ } = 2 7 5 { }$ ), respectively. Species of the tortuosum type, S. expansum and S. strictum also showed peaks corresponding to a $m / z$ of 274, but eluting at a RT of 5.49 min, which corresponded to $4 '$ -O-demethyl-mesmbrenone or $o$ -methyl-joubertiamine $( \\mathsf { M } \\mathsf { W } \\mathsf { s } = 2 7 3$ ). The peak eluting at a RT of 5.49 min seems to be associated only with tortuosum-type species, whereas the peak eluting at a RT of 5.09 min seems to be associated with emarcidum-type species. Furthermore, it appears that both of the individual compounds in each pair are present in one or other of the particular species. The tortuosum-type species S. tortuosum and S. expansum revealed the presence of mesembrine together with mesembrenone, mesembranol and epimesembranol, although the latter two were present in concentrations below their limits of quantification in S. expansum. S. strictum, on the other hand, was found to contain measurable concentrations of mesembrenone and mesembrine and either $4 '$ -O-demethyl-mesembrenone or 4’-O-demethyl-mesembrenol, based on the $m / z$ and RTs measured.
