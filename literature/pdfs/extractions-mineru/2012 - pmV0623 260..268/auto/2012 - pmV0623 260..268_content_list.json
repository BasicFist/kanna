Recently, products containing S. tortuosum have become increasingly popular and are commonly administered as tablets, capsules, teas, decoctions, or tinctures, while traditionally the dried plant material has been masticated. This study evaluated the in vitro perbmeability of the four major S. tortuosum alkaloids (i.e., mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol, and mesembranol) across porcine intestinal, sublingual, and buccal tissues in their pure form and in the form of three different crude plant extracts, namely water, methanol, and an acid-base alkaloid-enriched extract. The permeability of mesembrine across intestinal tissue was higher than that of the highly permeable reference compound caffeine (which served as a positive control for membrane permeability) both in its pure form, as well as in the form of crude extracts. The intestinal permeability of mesembranol was similar to that of caffeine, while those of mesembrenol and mesembrenone were lower than that of caffeine, but much higher than that of the poorly permeable reference compound atenolol (which served as a negative control for membrane permeability). In general, the permeabilities of the alkaloids were lower across the sublingual and the buccal tissues than across the intestinal tissue. However, comparing the transport of the alkaloids with that of the reference compounds, there are indications that transport across the membranes of the oral cavity may contribute considerably to the overall bioavailability of the alkaloids, depending on presystemic metabolism, when the plant material is chewed and kept in the mouth for prolonged periods. The results from this study confirmed the ability of the alkaloids of S. tortuosum in purified or crude extract form to permeate across intestinal, buccal, and sublingual mucosal tissues. ",

Br (Mesembryanthemaceae) is a succulent plant indigenous to South Africa that has traditionally been used as a masticatory and as a remedy to treat ailments affecting the central nervous system [1, 2]. The psychoactive properties are ascribed to the four major alkaloids: mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol, and mesembranol, collectively referred to as the mesembrine alkaloids [3]. The plant and its products have been prescribed for the management of psychiatric and psychological conditions including depression, anxiety [4], drug dependence, bulimia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder [3]. The potential for mesembrine alkaloids to treat central nervous system disorders has been attributed to their capacity to act as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, thereby contributing to regulating the balance of neurochemicals in the brain [5, 6]. Phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibition has been reported for an extract of S. tortuosum [7], and of the mesembrine alkaloids tested for PDE4 inhibitory activity, mesembrenone was found to be the most potent [8], while mesembrine-HCl was found to be a relatively weak inhibitor of the enzyme [5]. There is strong in vivo experimental evidence that PDE4 inhibitors can reverse depression, improve cognition and alleviate anxiety [9, 10]. Sceletium tortuosum plants and extracts with relatively high mesembrenone content, and isolated mesembrenone, can thus act as dual serotonin reuptake inhibitors and PDE4 inhibitors, while plant material relatively high in mesembrine and isolated mesembrine can act as highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The therapeutic advantages of dual inhibition of serotonin reuptake and PDE4 inhibition include the possibility of using a lower dose to achieve enhanced efficacy, with a reduced side effect profile [11].

The in vivo drug absorption process is a complex series of events, including permeation across epithelial cell membranes and presystemic metabolism. Numerous efforts have been made to identify screening models that are predictive of this process [16]. Several artificial membranes, cell culture techniques, and isolated mucosal tissues have been used to assess the transport of compounds across biological barriers [17]. Isolated tissues from several animals, such as rabbbits, monkeys, dogs, hamsters, and pigs, have been employed as models for evaluation of drug permeability [18]. However, excised porcine tissues including buccal, sublingual, and intestinal mucosa have been frequently utilised in drug transport studies, due to their similarity to human tissues in terms of drug transport [19, 20].

The corresponding $\\mathrm { P _ { a p p } }$ values calculated for the A– B transport across the intestinal mucosal tissue are depicted in $\\circ$ Fig. 2. The percentage transport results (l\" Table 3) clearly indicate a lag phase before the alkaloids were transported across the pig intestinal mucosal tissue. This can possibly be explained by the time needed for these hydrophilic compounds to diffuse through the unstirred water and mucous layer at the membrane surface before transport across the epithelial cell membrane could occur. The four alkaloids were transported at different rates and extents across the porcine intestinal tissue in the A–B direction, both as pure compounds and as crude extracts. Mesembrine consistently exhibited the highest permeability, which was statistically significantly higher, based on the $\\mathrm { P _ { a p p } }$ value $\\left( \\mathtt { p } \\le 0 . 0 5 \\right)$ in the A–B direction across the porcine intestinal tissue in all the experimental groups, despite its lower concentration in the crude extracts compared to the other alkaloids. This better transport of mesembrine can possibly be explained by active uptake transport, in addition to passive diffusion, but this must be confirmed by further investigations. One important implication of the higher permeability recorded for mesembrine compared to the other alkaloids is that when mesembrine, plant material, or extract high in mesembrine content, is taken orally, it is likely to be more rapidly transported across mucosal membranes and will possibly exhibit a more pronounced central nervous system effect. In this regard, it is important to note that mesembrine is transported statistically significantly better (based on $\\mathrm { P _ { a p p } }$ values, $\\mathrm { p } \\leq 0 . 0 5$ ) than the reference compound caffeine, a highly permeable molecule that served as a positive control for membrane permeability. This in vitro transport result therefore indicates very good permeability for mesembrine across the intestinal epithelium. ",

Transport enhancing effects by phytochemicals may include changes in the membrane fluidity, while transport reduction effects may occur by competitive inhibition of active transporters.

These results therefore indicate that none of the four mesembrine-alkaloids of S. tortuosum are substrates for efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2). This also indicates that the mesembrine alkaloids will potentially avoid the P‑gp efflux of the blood-brain barrier, which explains the CNS effects of these compounds. In accordance with the A–B transport results, the transport of mesembranol was higher in the B‑A direction when applied in the form of crude extracts compared to the pure isolated alkaloid.

        "text": "In most cases, alkaloid permeability across the sublingual mucosal tissue was poorer than that of caffeine (the highly permeable reference compound that served as a positive control for membrane permeability). However, mesembrenone in the water extract and mesembranol in the acid-base extract displayed similar $\\mathrm { P _ { a p p } }$ values as caffeine. The better permeabilities of mesembrenone and mesembranol from the crude extracts, compared to the pure compounds, can possibly be explained by the higher concentrations of these alkaloids in the extracts compared to that of mesembrine. In some experimental groups, the alkaloids were transported to a lesser extent across the sublingual mucosal tissue than across the intestinal mucosal tissue. However, the transport was still considered to be relatively good, because it was better than that of the poorly permeable reference compound, atenolol, that served as a negative control for membrane permability. The results therefore indicate that the alkaloids of S. tortuosum are relatively permeable across the sublingual mucosal tissue, which indicates a potential contribution to their overall bioavailability via this route, depending on presystemic metabolism. The negligible difference between the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values at the beginning and end of the experiments (data not shown) indicates that acceptable integrity of the tissues was maintained over the period of the transport study.

The other three S. tortuosum alkaloids also exhibited relatively good permeation across the intestinal tissue when compared to the reference compounds. Alkaloids were less permeable across the sublingual and buccal tissues than across the intestinal tissue and were less permeable than caffeine. However, the alkaloids were more permeable than atenolol, suggesting that transport across the mucosal membranes of the mouth cavity may contribute to their overall bioavailability, depending on presystemic metabolism, when the plant material is chewed or held in the mouth. The in vitro transport results indicated relatively good permeability for the S. tortuosum alkaloids across the intestinal, buccal, and sublingual mucosal membranes when interpreted in relation to the reference compounds (caffeine and atenolol).
