Included in this class is channaine, which was tentatively identified, without comprehensive structural elucidation from Sceletium tortuosum in 1957. Following its isolation from S. strictum, the structure of channaine was eventually resolved by X-ray crystallographic analysis, which revealed an unusual cage-like ring structure at the interface of two aryl-hydroindole subunits. However, since this report in 1978, channaine has not re-appeared in the literature. In this letter, the full NMR characterisation of channaine, isolated from S. tortuosum collected from St Helena in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, is reported for the first time. ",

Numerous related alkaloids have been isolated and characterised from the genus Sceletium, and from the Amaryllidaceae family, which is richly represented in South Africa (Fig. 1). These alkaloids have complex core structures and their diverse biological activities have resulted in innumerable studies into their chemical synthesis and biosynthesis (Das et al., 2015; Denmark and Marcin, 1997; Jeffs, 1981; Jin, 2016, 2013, 2009, 2007, 2005). The most prominent alkaloids of this class, including mesembrenone (1) and mesembrine (2) feature a distinct 3 ring aryl-hydroindole scaffold. However, several others, including the unnamed alkaloid (3) and sceletium alkaloid A-4 (4), feature an additional fourth ring attached to the parent scaffold. Furthermore, more diverse alkaloids of this class such as maritidine (5) and crinine (6) feature a fused azabicylcooctene ring, formed through a bond between the hydroindole nitrogen and position 6 of the respective aryl rings. Further diversity in the ring systems is observed in the unusual gracilamine $^ { ( 7 ) }$ , which features an esterified methyl leucine residue at the 6 position of the aryl ring, which in turn, forms covalent bonds with 2 positions on the hydroindole to form a complex 6-ring system.

This compound was assigned the trivial name channaine (8). This was followed by a review article by Popelak and Lettenbauer (1967), who had determined that channaine contained two veratrole rings, and was likely a dimer of two $\\mathrm { C _ { 1 6 } H _ { 1 9 } N O _ { 3 } }$ subunits.

Although initially unsuccessful, Jeffs and McPhail did manage to isolate an alkaloid from S. strictum with spectral data and physical properties that matched closely with those previously reported for channaine (Abou-Donia et al., 1978). However, owing to the lack of optical purity, they initially proposed that channaine is an artefact, resulting from the condensation of two putative $N$ -demethylmesembrenone subunits (which is yet to be isolated from a natural source), under either the acidic or basic conditions provided during the extraction process. However, following the synthesis of $N \\mathrm { . }$ -demethylmesembrenone, Jeffs et al. (1983), were unsuccessful in attempts to induce dimerization under either acidic or basic conditions, leading them to tentatively conclude that channaine is a natural product (Jeffs et al., 1983). Furthermore, mesembrenone, mesembranol and sceletium alkaloid A-4 have all been isolated as racemic mixtures (Snyckeres et al., 1971). ",

Finally, H-2 and H-3 were found to correlate through COSY.

Notably, inhibition of PDE has been investigated as an anti-cancer target (Hirsh et al., 2004; Savai et al., 2010), Furthermore, the catalytic domain of PDE enzymes is highly conserved between humans and protozoans, meaning that inhibition of PDEs has been exploited to inhibit several protozoan parasites, including malaria and trypanasoma.
