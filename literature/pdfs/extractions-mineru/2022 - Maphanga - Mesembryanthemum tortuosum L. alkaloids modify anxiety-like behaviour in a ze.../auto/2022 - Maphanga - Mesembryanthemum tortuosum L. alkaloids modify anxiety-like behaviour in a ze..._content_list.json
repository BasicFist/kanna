Inhibition of PDE4 results in the elevation of the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels with resultant modulation of second messenger effects and has been implicated in the regulation of anxiety and depression in animals models (O'Donnell and Zhang, 2004). For several decades serotonin and serotonin receptors have been linked to the aetiology of depression and the mechanisms fundamental to the response to antidepressant treatment (Yohn et al., 2O17; Bowman and Daws, 2019; Butler and Meegan, 2008; Dell'Osso et al., 2005; Reimold et al., 2008).

In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study (Terburg et al., 2O13) the potential synergistic effects of a PDE4 inhibitor and SSRI combination were investigated.A standardised extract of M.tortuosum, Zembrin? $( 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } )$ a dual 5-HT reuptake and PDE4 inhibitor,administered to 16 healthy study participants subjected to an anxiety-related activity demonstrated the anxiety-attenuating effects of M. tortuosum,providing supporting evidence for the effectiveness of the combination of a PDE4 inhibitor and an SSRI.

Scototaxis refers to the preference for darker over brightly lit environments by teleost fish (Maximino et al., 2OlO),whilst thigmotaxis is the preference for peripheral areas of a novel environment as opposed to the central area (Schno;rr et al.,2Ol2).Both behaviors,in addition to the high homology of zebrafish larva with mammals,present them as valuable models to perform many behavioral analysis,including anxiolytic-likeness.Other species such as rodents (Treit and Fundytus,l988; Prut and Belzung, 2003; Sousa et al., 20o6; Belzung and Philippot, 20o7), other fish species (López-Patin;o et al., 2008; Peitsaro et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2009; ",

These were subsequently validated using AdmetSAR 2.0.All the alkaloids have a molecular weight below $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { g / m o l }$ ,and based on the in silico predictions,all the alkaloids were shown to possess the following properties:an octanol-water partition coefficient below 5,hydrogen bond donors below 5,and hydrogen bond acceptors below 1o.This suggested an adherence of all the alkaloids to Lipinski's rules of five (Lipinski et al.,2Ol2), thus predicting their drug-likeness and potential suitability for bioactivity.Adherence of the alkaloids to Lipinski's rule of five further suggested favourable oral bioavailability and a tendency to cross various aqueous and lipophilic barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the gastrointestinal tract (Lipinski et al., 2O12). The prediction of the lipophilicity of the alkaloids on SwissADME was based on the Brain Or IntestinaL EstimateD permeation method (BOILED-Egg) concept (Daina and Zoete, 2Ol6). As shown in Table 1,each of the alkaloids was shown to fall within the suitable physicochemical space (colored zone) correlating with oral bioavailability.The ability of the alkaloids to cross lipophilic barriers was also evidenced by a LogPow of less than 5,representing favourable lipophilicity (Lipinski et al., 2001) and a topological polar surface area (TPSA) below $\\overset { \\cdot } { _ { 1 4 0 \\hat { \\mathrm { A } } } }$ 、A predicted TPSA below $\\overset { - } { 1 4 0 } \\overset { - } { \\mathbb { A } }$ for all the alkaloids suggested the ability of the alkaloids to be transported across the lipid bilayer and the BBB since TPSA takes into account polar atoms on the surfaces of the compounds (Ertl et al., 20oo; Prasanna and Doerksen, 2009; Shityakov et al., 2013). To augment their predicted drug-likeness and lipophilicity, the $\\mathrm { L D } _ { 5 0 }$ of the alkaloids,a parameter that assesses the differential toxicities when orally administered,was also predicted using the ProTox platform. Compounds with an oral $\\mathrm { L D } _ { 5 0 }$ of $0 { - } 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ are considered highly toxic,whereas compounds with $\\mathrm { L D } _ { 5 0 }$ greater than $2 0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ are less toxic (Morris-Schaffer and McCoy，2021).Accordingly，it could be deduced that the alkaloids would present no oral toxicity since they each showed $\\mathrm { L D } _ { 5 0 }$ values above $0 { - } 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ ,as shown in Table 1.

Also,all the alkaloids were predicted to be potential substrates and inhibitors of CYP450 2D6,except mesembrine,which was the only non-inhibitor of CYP450 2D6.As substrates of CYP450 2D6,an enzyme implicated in the metabolism of about $2 5 \\%$ of current drugs in clinical use,including known antidepressants like paroxetine, suggests a guarantee of the metabolism of the alkaloids upon absorption (Ingelman-- Sundberg et al.， 2007; Vuppalanchi, 2011). The predicted potential inhibition of CYP450 2D6 is characteristic of cotreatment with SERT inhibitors,leading to a decrease in the metabolism of substrate drugs (Tirona and Kim, 2017).

Since 2o1O M.tortuosum has been the subject of much in vitro and invivo research,as well as clinical studies,with respect to its CNS activity.All these studies,with the exception of Fountain (2Ol6),corroborated its mood elevation,antidepressant or antiepileptic activity (Gericke and Viljoen,2008; Harvey et al., 201l; Loria et al., 2014; Schell, 2014; Carpenter etal., 2014; Dimpfel etal., 2018). The anxiolytic-like effects of M.tortuosum have also been studied and substantiated by some research groups (Dimpfel et al., 2018; Fountain, 2016). In a recent study by Maphanga et al.(2O2O) on various extracts of M. tortuosum, the aqueous extract exhibited the highest anxiolytic-like activity in the larvalzebrafishlight-darkchallengemodelofanxiety; reverse-thigmotaxis behaviour was evaluated,and the increased time spent in the central arena demonstrated the superior anxiolytic-like activity of the water extract to that of other less polar extracts.These promising results prompted further analysis of compounds potentially responsible for the bioactivity of the water extract.

        "text": "The pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties of an administered drug are crucial to its absorption,distribution,metabolism, excretion,and toxicity (ADMET) (Klopman et al., 2O02; Lin and Lu, 1997; Lombardo et al., 2017; Tahir ul Qamar et al., 2019; Van de Waterbeemd and Gifford, 2Oo3). These properties affect the bioavailability of the drug and,consequently,its safety and efficacy as a therapeutic agent. The ADMET properties can be investigated via experimental methods; however, these are usually time-consuming and expensive.Therefore,multiple computational tools were employed, namely；Molinspiration Cheminformatics (Ertl,2Oo2)，SwissADME (Daina et al., 2017), AdmetSAR 2.0 (Cheng et al., 2012; Hongbin et al., 2019),and ProTox (Drwal et al., 2Ol4), to evaluate the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds under investigation, as these relate to the possible inhibitory activity of the alkaloids. The application of multiple predictive tools was to allow for the reproducibility of the results while validating the methods.Harvey et al. (2011), in a study of the effects of a standardised ethanolic extract of M.tortuosum,commercially available as Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ and the purified isolated alkaloids,found that the extract exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the SERT $\\left( \\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } ~ 4 . 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L } \\right)$ as well as on PDE4 $\\mathrm { ( I C } _ { 5 0 } ~ 8 . 5$ $\\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { m L } )$ ，but no effect was observed on other PDEs.Mesembrenol, mesembrenone,and mesembrine inhibited binding to the SERT but showed minimal effect at GABA receptors.Mesembrine was the most potent inhibitor of the SERT (Ki $1 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { n M }$ . Of the isolated alkaloids, mesembrenone exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect on PDE4 $( \\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } < 1 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ,as well as an inhibitory effect on the SERT $( \\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } < 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ None of the alkaloids displayed cytotoxicity.The authors concluded that while all three alkaloids are responsible for the observed anxiolytic-like and anti-depressant effects of Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { \\textregistered } }$ ，mesembrine，and mesembrenone contribute the greatest portion to the physiological effect,as per binding assay predictions.Fountain (2Ol6) studied the effects of M.tortuosum in a chick anxiety-depression model and showed that an alkaloid enriched M.tortuosum extract reduced anxiety but did not show any effect on depression in this model.

(2020, 2019) and Slack et al. (2019) as pertinent residues in the inhibition of SERT.Another interesting factor to consider is the structural properties of the alkaloid molecules.Mesembrenol and mesembranol have a hydroxyl group on carbon six,while mesembrine and mesembrenone have a carbonyl group on the same carbon.Thus,there is a connection between the structural activity of these alkaloids (Dimpfel et al., 2O18). The importance of these groups to the structural activity of the respective alkaloids was corroborated in this report by the implication of the groups in the formation of peculiar intermolecular interactions with SERT binding pocket residues observed in the molecular docking performed,and consequently accounted for the favourable SERT-binding affinity of the respective alkaloids.

Since most of the compounds showed activity at the higher concentrations applied, this suggests that mesembrenone and its derivatives may exert their anxiolytic-like activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies using a wider concentration range will be necessary to confirm this.Based on these facts,M. tortuosum alkaloids have demonstrated a possible anxiolytic-like effect as evidenced by their effects on hyper-locomotor activity and thigmotaxis behavior of zebrafish larvae in the light-dark challenge.
