        "text": "Background: Depression is a disorder that leads to disability worldwide and its liability seems to increase in the future. The Phytoconstituents as medicinal drugs obtained from various plants have remarkable attention towards drug discovery for various disease treatments using different techniques. Mesembrine, Mesembrenone, and Mesembranol obtained from a plant extract of Sceletium tortuosum were reported as potent Antidepressants. Objective: The current effort deals with computational study of a few Phytoconstituents obtained from plant extract as potent Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors in the treatment of depression and their comparison with standard drug Imipramine. Methods: In silico methods were adopted to study the interactions between Phosphodiesterase 4 as receptor and mesembrine, mesembrenone, and mesembranolas ligands. Docking studies of selected Phytoconstituentswere carried using autodock 4.2 and autodock vina (PyRxtool) to assess and compare the binding energies of these Phytoconstituents with receptor to the binding energy of Imipramine. Analysis of docking results was done using a discovery studio visualizer. The validation of the receptor was carried out by a pro-check validation tool. For the drug likeliness, the drulito tool was used. Results: Analysis of docking result showed that all Phytoconstituents found to have better binding energy with Phosphodiesterase 4 receptor and can act as potent antidepressant agents. Mesembrenone, Mesembrine, and Mesembranol showed the estimated free binding energy of-8.2 kcal/mol, -8.1kcal/mol, and - $8 . 0 \\mathrm { k c a l / m o l }$ respectively with Phosphodiesterase 4. All selected Phytoconstituents showed better binding energy than imipramine $\\left( - 7 . 9 \\mathrm { ~ k c a l / m o l } \\right)$ with Phosphodiesterase 4. Conclusion: Based on the computational study, it was concluded that compounds from a medicinal plant with promising biological activity can recognize as a valuable and alternative drug lead for depression treatment.

Based on results we can conclude that the three Phytoconstituents, mesembrenone, mesembrine, and mesembranol should be extended for in Vitro and pre-clinical studies as potent and safe Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors to improve quality of life by regulating mood and reversal of functional and social incapacitiesconcomitant with depression. Molecular docking continues to hold great promise in the field of computer-based drug design which screens small molecules by orienting and scoring them in the binding site of the targeted protein.
