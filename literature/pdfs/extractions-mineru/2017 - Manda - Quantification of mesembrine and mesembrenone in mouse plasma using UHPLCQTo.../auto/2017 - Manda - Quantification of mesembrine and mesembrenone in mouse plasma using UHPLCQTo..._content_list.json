Mesembrenone and mesembrine are the two main pharmacologically active alkaloids present in the extract. Despite the wide therapeutic applications of Sceletium extract, there are no reports of in vivo pharmacokinetic properties or analytical methods to quantify these two important alkaloids in plasma.Therefore, the current study aimed to develop and validate a simple and sensitive analytical method for simultaneous quantification of mesembrenone and mesembrine in mouse plasma. UItra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QToF-MS) was employed to achieve our objectives. The compounds were extracted using protein precipitation by methanol ( $. 1 0 0 \\%$ with quinine as an internal standard. The lower limit of quantification for both the compounds was $1 0 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ .The extraction recovery was between 87 and $9 3 \\%$ for both compounds with no matrix effects on the analysis. The accuracy was between 89.5 and $106 \\%$ and precision was $< 1 2 . 6 \\%$ for all quality control samples.This validated method was successfully applied to evaluate the i.v. plasma pharmacokinetics of mesembrine and mesembrenone in mouse. However, the oral bioavailability of these alkaloids was poor and the plasma levels were below the detection limits. ",

There are several alkaloids present in Kanna, however， the two main pharmacologically active alkaloids being reported to be mesembrenone and mesembrine (Harvey et al., 2011). Mesembrine,the majoralkaloid in Kanna,isa potent 5-HT inhibitor. Additionally,it has been shown to effectively inhibit PDE4 (Gericke & Viljoen,2Oo8).Mesembrine is a bicyclic molecule with two bridgehead chiral carbons between the five-membered ring and the six-membered ring (Figure 1)．Mesembrenone is structurally similar to mesembrine except for the presence of a double bond on C4 and C5( Figure 1).Mesembrenone has been shown to have a cytotoxic effect in cancer cells (Weniger et al.,1995),in addition to its anti-5HT and PDE4 inhibition properties.Mesembrine is a more potent 5-HT inhibitor while mesembrenone is more potent towards PDE4.These differences were attributed to the structural differences between the two molecules (Harvey etal.,2O11).In addition,reports have indicated that these alkaloids may have potential in other inflammatory diseases like ",

The pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated from the concentration-time profile (Figure 3) of both compounds using Phoenix-WinNonlin software (Pharsight, CA, USA).The elimination half-life $( T _ { 1 / 2 } )$ of mesembrenoneand mesembrine was $0 . 7 9 \\pm 0 . 1 1$ and $0 . 6 0 \\pm 0 . 0 5 \\mathsf { h }$ ,respectively,with corresponding clearance (CL) values of $4 7 \\pm 6$ and $7 2 \\pm 1 4 \\lfloor / \\mathrm { h / k g }$ .The time to reach maximum concentration $( T _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } )$ was very short for both mesembrenone $( 0 . 0 8 \\pm 0 . 0 1 \\mathrm { h } )$ and mesembrine $( 0 . 0 9 \\pm 0 . 0 2 \\mathsf { h } )$ ,witha rapid decline in plasma concentrations suggesting that both the compounds are rapidly distributed to other tissues from plasma. The maximum concentration in plasma $\\left( { \\mathsf { C } } _ { \\mathsf { m a x } } \\right)$ and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for mesembrenone $( 4 2 0 \\pm 3 2 \\mathrm { n g } /$ $\\mathsf { m L }$ and $3 0 5 \\pm 2 7 \\mathrm { h } \\mathrm { \\ n g / m L } )$ were higher compared with mesembrine $( 3 3 6 \\pm 2 4 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ and $2 0 3 \\pm 2 2 \\mathrm { h } \\mathrm { \\ n g / m L } )$ .Therepresentative chromatograms of plasma collected from mice at various time intervals afteri.v.administration of mesembrenone and mesembrine are shown in Figure 4.It was interesting to note that,after oral administration of the enriched S.tourtuosum extract,both mesembrine and mesembrenone $( 7 5 \\mathrm { m g / k g ) }$ were not detected in plasma (data not shown).This data suggests that these alkaloids have very low oral bioavailability.A recent study has shown that mesembrine and mesembrenone are metabolically unstable in human liver microsomes (Meyer et al.,2O15).Additional factors such as instability in gastric and intestinal fluids may further contribute to observed low bioavailability of mesembrine and mesembrenone observed in this study.

The detection limit is $1 0 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ for both compounds.The method was validated for linearity,precision,accuracy, LOD and LOQ.The calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients ${ > } 0 . 9 9$ .Using the validated method，the i.v. pharmacokinetics of mesembrine and mesembrenone were evaluated.However,the plasma concentrations of two alkaloids after an oral dose were not detectable,indicating a low oral bioavailability.The method can be applied to the analysis of large number of samples with a high sensitivity.
