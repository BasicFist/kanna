        "text": "The aboriginal use of botanical hallucinogens has been nowhere more extensive and varied than in the Americas. This is well underscored by the book 'Pflanzen der Gotter' which was compiled by two eminent experts in this field, Schultes and Hofmann (1980a). Of 91 reviewed plants with proven or alleged hallucinogenic potential, two-thirds have been applied only or mainly in the Western Hemisphere,and 8 of the world's 14 major hallucinogens are completely rooted in Amerindian tradition.These figures contrast sharply with the listing of just one established hallucinogen and four possible hallucinogens that have been used exclusively on the African continent (Table 1). A major reason for this difference may well be that American Indians retained the fundamental shamanism characteristic of hunting societies and thus more actively sought mystic visionary experiences by means of hallucinogenic plants than many peoples of the Old World (La Barre 1970). However, these proportions between American and African hallucinogens may also reflect to some extent that Professor Schultes and his followers at Harvard University did most of their ethnobotanical field work on the American side of the Atlantic Ocean. It would therefore be understandable if their publications would provide the most comprehensive coverage for this part of the world. As a result, the ethnobotany of African hallucinogens could be more varied than has been assumed so far. ",

Buphanidrine,undulatine,buphanisine,buphanamine and nerbowdine emerged as major alkaloids (Table 2). The hallucinogenic efficacy of Boophane disticha was documented by Laing (1979),who reported on three young men presenting at a Zimbabwean hospital the morning after they had taken the bulb.One of them was deeply unconscious,and had dilated pupils, tachycardia, raised blood pressure,a slightly raised temperature and labored respiration. He remained in this state for $2 4 \\ \\mathbf { h }$ and could be discharged after $^ { 7 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ with a normal pulse, blood pressure and temperature. Another youngster appeared to suffer from an acute psychotic episode with violent hallucinations.His physical signs were similar to those in the first victim but less marked.He was treated with intravenous chlorpromazine to sedate him and after $3 6 \\ \\mathbf { h }$ he had recovered. The third young man,who was not admitted, claimed that he had taken the decoction with the other two.He had spent the night feeling drunk and seeing visions and felt perfectly well the following morning. On examination,the only abnormal sign was slightly dilated pupils. After recovery,all three men claimed that the hallucinatory effect of the bulb was well known in their area (the Gutu district).

Among the vernacular names of the drug were Sata mbwanda (Nkomi) and SetÃ© mbwunde (Bakole). Chevalier identified the already known Mostuea gabonica Baillon and a new species, Mostuea stimulans,as source plants. According to Walkerï¼Œ the natives considered the roots as a potent aphrodisiac and claimed that it had an action comparable to that of Tabernanthe iboga. During nights consecrated to drumming and dancing,they would chew the roots and gratings to dispel sleep,but more often the roots were consumed,alone or mixed with iboga, because of the sexual excitation they provoked. Exaggerated use of the drug could lead to cerebral troubles. According to Chevalier, the chewed or powdered root bark first tasted very bitter when put into the mouth,and then induced salivation and acquired a taste reminiscent of a fresh kola nut. It produced a certain euphoria and,if the dose was a bit strong, a sort of intoxication was experienced. ",
