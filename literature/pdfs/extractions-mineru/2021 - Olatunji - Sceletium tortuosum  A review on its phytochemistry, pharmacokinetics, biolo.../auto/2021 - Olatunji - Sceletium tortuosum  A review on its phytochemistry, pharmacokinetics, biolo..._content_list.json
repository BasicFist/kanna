The fruit capsule contains several kidney-shaped seeds that are brown to black in colour (Gericke and Viljoen, 2Oo8).The genus is distributed in the south-western parts of South Africa, from Namaqualand to Montagu through to Aberdeen,and commonly occurs in quartz patches (Fig. 2). It is usually found growing under shrubs in partial shade and has an afinity for arid environments (Chesselet, 20o5). Although S. tortuosum shares numerous morphological traits with other species in the genus,it is usually distinguished from other species by comparing the flower,seed,fruit,and vegetative characteristics (Shikanga et al.,2013; Appleton, 2021).

        "text": "Sceletium tortuosum is commonlyknownas‘kougoed'or‘kanna'and has been used by South African pastoralists and hunter-gatherers as a mood-altering substance from historic times (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Shikanga et al., 2011; Gericke, 2018; Appleton, 2021). The first known written account of the plant's use,referred to as Kanna,was in 1662 by Jan van Riebeeck. According to Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), S.tortuosum is used as a narcotic,and farmers in the Cape used it as a decoction ora tincture and as a sedative.The narcotic effectis claimed to be much more pronounced after fermentation (Smith et al.,1996; Chen and Viljoen, 2O19a).The leaf is also chewed to relieve toothache and abdominal pain (Yin et al.,2O19) and as a hunger and thirst suppressant during hunting trips (Gericke, 2O2O). The following was an early statement describing the clinical effects observed after S.tortuosum plant material was chewed: “Zwicky chewed $5 g$ of kougoed',the result being a bitter,astringent taste and an inclination to vomit, tingling of the tongue followed byweak and fairly persistent analgesia of the mouth, the pulse remaining normal.\"(Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). The traditionally prepared dried Sceletium was often chewed and the liquid from it swallowed,but it has also been prepared into tablets,gel caps, teas,and tinctures.It is also used as a snuff and smoked (Meyer et al., 2015).In pregnant women,S. tortuosum is usually chewed to treat constipation,indigestion and nausea.An infusion of S.tortuosum is taken to contract the uterus,exorcize any residual after birth,and to relieve abdominal pain in women who have just given birth (Gericke, 2018). Additionally,oil extracted from the fried mix of S.tortuosumand the end portion of a sheep's tail is given to relieve colic in babies (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Gericke, 2018). ",

(1971) reported the structures of a partial racemic Sceletium alkaloid and tortuosamine, Jeffs et al.(1982) confirmed the structure of mesembrine and listed two additional unidentified ketonic alkaloids,which remained unidentified. Only in 1998 did Smith et al. (1998) identify mesembrenol, mesembrineandmesembrenoneinfermented S.tortuosum. Patnala and Kanfer (2Oo9a） investigated the transformation of alkaloids during fermentation.They reproduced the fermentation process of S.tortuosum and included the fermentation of pure mesembrine hydrochloride under controlled conditions, including exposure to sunlight and fermentation at ambient and elevated temperatures. They found that mesembrine transformed into mesembrenone,with the mesembrine concentration decreasing from $1 . 3 3 \\%$ to $0 . 0 5 \\%$ ,and mesembrenone increasing from below the limit of detection to $0 . 1 1 \\%$ .The pure mesembrine hydrochloride underwent the same transformation in aqueous solutions,but not in methanolic solutions or when kept in the dark.This transformation is not stoichiometric,but unfortunately,other chemical transformations or degradation products that may have occurred during fermentation were not investigated.

Escitalopram oxalate $5 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ and Zembrin $^ \\mathrm { \\textregistered }$ at $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ and $5 0 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ showed significant dose-dependent reversal of immobility (anti-depressant effects) in FSL rats and variable effects on coping behaviors.Closer scrutiny found Zembrin $^ \\mathrm { \\textregistered }$ $5 0 \\mathrm { \\ m g / k g }$ to be the most effective antidepressant dose,with equivalence to $5 ~ \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ ESC in an associated chronic treatment study over 15 days (Gericke,2020). However， both treatments alone did not show a significant antidepressant-like effect in the FST.The latter findings require confirmation and further study.That said, the combination of S. tortuosum 50 $\\mathrm { { m g / k g } }$ and ESC at $5 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ significantly increased hippocampal levels of serotonin,norepinephrine,as well as increased locomotor activity. Furthermore,treatment with Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { \\textregistered } }$ $( 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ alone） showed a significant increase in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).The above-mentioned monoaminergic and neurotrophin effects are positive indices in major depressive disorder treatment (Brand et al., 2015),while also indicating procognitive effects and improved neuroplasticity，which warrants further study.That an antidepressant response to Zembrin? could only be confirmed following acute,but not chronic treatment, may be due to the model used (viz.FSL rat),advocating further studies using other translational models.

Diazepam and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMsO) served as the positive and negative control, respectively.Reverse-thigmotaxis behaviour,which indicates anxiolytic activity，and general locomotor activity were analyzed in anxiety-induced zebrafish larvae.The results showed that S.tortuosum water extract of the 15 non-toxic extracts demonstrated the highest anxiolytic activity.Hence,S.tortuosumwater extract was further evaluated for detailed behavioral effects.The result revealed that different tested concentrations of S. tortuosum water extract showed anxiolytic activity (reverse-thigmotaxis) on the zebrafish larvae when light-dark transitions and spontaneous locomotor activity were considered.Furthermore,during the $4 0 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ of continuous illumination challenge,S.tortuosum water extract showed significant anxiolytic activity at two concentrations (12.5 and $2 5 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { L }$ $\\mathrm { P } < 0 . 0 1$ $\\mathrm { P } < 0 . 0 5$ respectively) on the zebrafish larvae when compared with the control group (DMSO treated group).Collectively, the results indicate the therapeutic potentials of S.tortuosum in managing anxiety.

Inadequate pharmacotherapy and increasing prevalence of resistance to current antidepressants represent a severe related health burden (WHO, 2017). Old generation groups of antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs),monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SsRIs) remain the primary treatment for the disorder (Brand et al., 2Ol5).Although the majority of the patient diagnosed with MDD respond well to clinical antidepressant treatment, $1 0 { - } 3 0 \\%$ of patients do not improve and go on to display further symptoms of depression (Al-Harbi, 20l2). Multiple mechanisms are implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD (Brand et al., 2O15). Therefore, a strategy of using antidepressants with dual-or triple action as first-line treatment,or to augment first-line treatment with agents with multiple modes of action (Dupuy et al., 2Ol1), will allow the simultaneous targeting of deficits in central brain monoamines,dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA）axis,neuroinflammation, impaired neuroplasticity，genetic predisposition，and environmental influences,among others (Brand and Harvey, 20l7). Indeed, different symptoms of depression may be targeted by specifically addressing specific pathological processes in other regions of the brain,and in this way improve long-term outcomes. By virtue of its multi-mode of action (Table 3),S.tortuosum is indeed attractive as a possible augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).As noted earlier,the presence of different chemotypes of S. tortuosum are relevant here. Assessment in specific translational animal models of TRD (Brand and Harvey，2017；Mncube et al.，202l） are recommended as proof of concept before clinical assessment. It also needs to be borne in mind that commercial availability of complementary medicines often sees herbal preparations being used without medical supervision, even in combination with prescribed treatments (Ravindran and Da Silva, 2O13). This poses a serious risk for possible drug interactions and toxicity,e.g. serotonin syndrome when SSRIs are co-administered with for instance Saint John's wort (Sarris,2Ol8).Given the serotonergic actions of ST (Table 4) (Harvey et al., 2O11),and similar supportive evidence from our laboratory (Gericke,202O),such studies need to be undertaken. These real-world issues,plus that plant constituents may have interacting effects with one another,warrant dedicated research into the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles of herbal medicines (Sarris, 2O18). Such studies need to be carried out with S. tortuosum. ",

Its primary psychoactive and addictive effects are mediated through an increase in mesolimbic dopamine levels (Kish,2Oo8), through inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) (Liischer, 2O15).Moreover,MA also increases other monoamines such as noradrenaline and serotonin (Kish, 2008),through inhibition of the noradrenaline transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (SERT);(Lischer,2O15), leading to feelings of alertness,energy,and euphoria (Panenka et al.,2O13).Methamphetamine also influences inflammatory pathways,via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)- phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)- cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signal cascade (or cAMP-PDE4-CREB signal cascade); (Olsen and Liu, 2Ol6),leading to a pro-inflammatory state.By displaying dual inhibitory effects on SERT and PDE4,as well as its anti-inflammatory (Loria et al.,2O14), S. tortuosum may be an interesting candidate with potential in treating MA addiction.Indeed, S.tortuosum has shown concentration-dependent activity at neuronal receptors known to be involved in addiction,e.g.mu- and delta-opioid receptors (Harvey et al., 2011; Loria et al., 2014; Carpenter et al., 2016).Pre-clinical animal models of addiction may be especially suitable for addressing this question (Kalivas et al., 2Oo6).These models can be specially adapted to examine S.tortuosum co-administered with MA, specifically addressing the development of addiction,or administered post MA exposure (viz.during MA withdrawal),which more explores the treatment of symptom manifestation of MA addiction.A recent animal study considered whether Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { \\textregistered } }$ could modify the behavioral and neurochemical profile of MA (Postma,2O2l). The authors concluded that in this context and model, the monoaminergic actions of Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ as described earlier,acts as a stimulant during MA exposure. This is not unlike the pro-dopaminergic actions of anti-addictive agents like bupropion (Postma,2O2l),and hints at its possible utility as an anti-addictive agent.However, further investigation into the mechanism of action of Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ during addictive states is needed,and whether it is capable of reversing psychotogenic drug-induced addictive-like behaviour.

Evidently, these distressing statistics highlight the severity of this global disorder (Bueno-Notivol et al.,2O2l).

Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by immune-inflammatory states, while treatments for these disorders have distinct anti-inflammatory properties and effects (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021).With inflammation being a common contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2,as well as psychiatric disorders (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021), S. tortuosum may be of interest as it has antidepressant as well as mild anti-inflammatory properties,without hindering an adequate immune response to acute immune challenges.It also exerts antiviral effects,although current evidence has focused on its potential against HIV (Bennett and Smith, 2018; Kapewangolo et al., 2016).

        "text": "The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the number of research outputs regarding S. tortuosum, which emphasizes the growing scientific interest in this medicinal herb.For example;Science Direct lists only 8 studies that were published between 1967 and 2001,16 articles during 2oo2-201O and an astonishing 87 articles were published since 2ol1 until now.Of note,the quality of research seemed to have improved in the sense that many recent studies have been conducted using standardized extracts that were investigated in in vivo animal or human trials. Standardization of herbal treatments is of critical importance to ensure consistent efficacy and safety.However, there is still a need to conduct well designed and sufficiently powered clinical trials using participants suffering from the various diseases as listed in this review in order to firmly establisha risk:benefit ratio for standardized formulations of S.tortuosum.
