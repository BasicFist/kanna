        "text": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E.Br, the most sought after and widely researched species in the genus Sceletium is a succulent forb endemic to South Africa. Traditionally, this medicinal plant is mainly masticated or smoked and used for the relief of toothache, abdominal pain, and as a mood-elevator, analgesic, hypnotic, anxiolytic, thirst and hunger suppressant, and for its intoxicating/euphoric effects. Scele­ tium tortuosum is currently of widespread scientific interest due to its clinical potential in treating anxiety and depression, relieving stress in healthy individuals, and enhancing cognitive functions. These pharmacological actions are attributed to its phytochemical constituents referred to as mesembrine-type alkaloids. Aim of the review: The aim of this review was to comprehensively summarize and critically evaluate recent research advances on the phytochemistry, pharmacokinetics, biological and clinical activities of the medicinal plant S. tortuosum. Additionally, current ongoing research and future perspectives are also discussed. Methods: All relevant scientific articles, books, MSc and Ph.D. dissertations on botany, behavioral pharmacology, traditional uses, and phytochemistry of S. tortuosum were retrieved from different databases (including Science Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science). For pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects of S. tortuosum, the focus fell on relevant publications published between 2009 and 2021. Results: Twenty-five alkaloids belonging to four structural classes viz: mesembrine, Sceletium A4, joubertiamine, and tortuosamine, have been identified from S. tortuosum, of which the mesembrine class is predominant. The crude extracts and commercially available standardized extracts of S. tortuosum have displayed a wide spectrum of biological activities (e.g. antimalarial, anti-oxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-HIV, neuroprotection, enhancement of cognitive function) in in vitro or in vivo studies. This plant has not yet been studied in a clinical population, but has potential for enhancing cognitive function, and managing anxiety and depression. Conclusion: As an important South African medicinal plant, S. tortuosum has garnered many research advances on its phytochemistry and biological activities over the last decade. These scientific studies have shown that S. tortuosum has various bioactivities. The findings have further established the link between the phytochemistry and pharmacological application, and support the traditional use of S. tortuosum in the indigenous medicine of South Africa.

The plant is chewed for the relief of abdominal pain, toothache, and hunger, and fresh juice from the plant is given to induce sleep in young children (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). It is currently used commercially to treat different central nervous system (CNS) related disorders, including stress, depression, and anxiety (Yin et al., 2019).

The calyx has four or five sepals, and fruits are 10–15 mm in diameter and open when wet. The fruit capsule contains several kidney-shaped seeds that are brown to black in colour (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). The genus is distributed in the south-western parts of South Africa, from Namaqualand to Montagu through to Aberdeen, and commonly occurs in quartz patches (Fig. 2). It is usually found growing under shrubs in partial shade and has an affinity for arid environments (Chesselet, 2005). Although S. tortuosum shares numerous morpholog­ ical traits with other species in the genus, it is usually distinguished from other species by comparing the flower, seed, fruit, and vegetative characteristics (Shikanga et al., 2013; Appleton, 2021). Only two species in the genus (S. tortuosum and S. crassicaule) produce the four important mesembrine-type alkaloids responsible for their psychoactive properties (Shikanga et al., 2013; Appleton, 2021).

The first known written account of the plant’s use, referred to as Kanna, was in 1662 by Jan van Riebeeck. According to Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), S. tortuosum is used as a narcotic, and farmers in the Cape used it as a decoction or a tincture and as a sedative. The narcotic effect is claimed to be much more pronounced after fermentation (Smith et al., 1996; Chen and Viljoen, 2019a). The leaf is also chewed to relieve toothache and abdominal pain (Yin et al., 2019) and as a hunger and thirst suppressant during hunting trips (Gericke, 2020). The following was an early statement describing the clinical effects observed after S. tortuosum plant material was chewed: “Zwicky chewed 5 g of ‘kougoed’, the result being a bitter, astringent taste and an inclination to vomit, tingling of the tongue followed by weak and fairly persistent analgesia of the mouth, the pulse remaining normal.” (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). The traditionally prepared dried Sceletium was often chewed and the liquid from it swallowed, but it has also been prepared into tablets, gel caps, teas, and tinctures. It is also used as a snuff and smoked (Meyer et al., 2015). In pregnant women, S. tortuosum is usually chewed to treat constipation, indigestion and nausea. An infusion of S. tortuosum is taken to contract the uterus, exorcize any residual after birth, and to relieve abdominal pain in women who have just given birth (Gericke, 2018). Additionally, oil extracted from the fried mix of S. tortuosum and the end portion of a sheep’s tail is given to relieve colic in babies (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Gericke, 2018). ",

However, the chemical structures were later corrected by Popelak and Lettenbauer (1967). While Snyckers et al. (1971) reported the structures of a partial racemic Sceletium alkaloid and tortuosamine, Jeffs et al. (1982) confirmed the structure of mesembrine and listed two additional unidentified ketonic alkaloids, which remained unidentified. Only in 1998 did Smith et al. (1998) identify mesembrenol, mesembrine and mesembrenone in fermented S. tortuosum. Patnala and Kanfer (2009a) investigated the trans­ formation of alkaloids during fermentation. They reproduced the fermentation process of S. tortuosum and included the fermentation of pure mesembrine hydrochloride under controlled conditions, including exposure to sunlight and fermentation at ambient and elevated tem­ peratures. They found that mesembrine transformed into mesem­ brenone, with the mesembrine concentration decreasing from 1.33% to 0.05%, and mesembrenone increasing from below the limit of detection to 0.11%. The pure mesembrine hydrochloride underwent the same transformation in aqueous solutions, but not in methanolic solutions or when kept in the dark. This transformation is not stoichiometric, but unfortunately, other chemical transformations or degradation products that may have occurred during fermentation were not investigated. ",

The HPTLC method was validated, and the results obtained from the sample analysis correlated well with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. In the same year, the same research group published a validated method using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) with a reversed-phase column and photodiode array (PDA) detection to quantify the four alkaloids in S. tortuosum (Shikanga et al., 2012c). Roscher et al. (2012) developed a nonaqueous chemical electrophoresis (NACE) mass spectrometry (MS) method for the separation and quan­ tification of alkaloids in a S. tortuosum extract. Manda et al. (2015) developed and validated a sensitive UHPLC-MS method for the accurate quantification of mesembrenone and mesembrine in mouse plasma. Freund et al. (2018) developed a leaf spray MS technique in order to facilitate the rapid detection of plant metabolites without using chro­ matography. Fresh leaf material of S. tortuosum was analyzed, and the major mesembrine alkaloids were detected with the MS method. Lesiak et al. (2016) characterized S. tortuosum directly using real-time ioniza­ tion coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight (HRTOF) mass spec­ trometry (MS). This method identified the material as S. tortuosum, but at the same time, it identified a scheduled substance (in this case, the stimulant ephedrine), which has been banned in herbal products and supplements.

Their results indicated that mesembrenol and mesembranol remained largely un­ changed, whereas the concentration of mesembrine increased from be­ tween not detected and 1.6 μg/mL to 7.4–20.8 μg/mL, whereas mesembrenone decreased from 8.0 to 33.0 to 1.3–32.7 μg/mL. This result is in direct contrast with Patnala and Kanfer (2009a), Roscher et al. (2012), and Smith et al. (1998), who reported the exact opposite transformation occurring during fermentation. As mentioned before, Chen and Viljoen (2019a) concluded that the mesembrine levels declined or remained constant after fermentation. They were however the only researchers who complied with the following three criteria: (1) They compared fermented and unfermented material from the same plant and in triplicate using genetically consistent cultivated material. (2) They also used a validated method, which was not the case in one of the other studies. (3) Finally, the fermentation was done under controlled conditions, which was not the case for most of the other studies. ",

The results indicate good bioavailability of the alkaloids when the plant is chewed. Based on these permeability results across buccal and sublingual epithelial tissues, as well as the traditional way (mastication) of taking S. tortuosum, a study was conducted to formulate S. tortuosum extract into a chewing gum as a delivery system.

The neuroprotective effects of S. tortuosum extract fractions were evaluated in experimental neuro­ toxicity induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in mouse N2a cells, and L-glutamate in PC12 cells using the MTT assay.

The result of the neu­ roprotective screening showed that both ethyl acetate and petroleum ether fractions of S. tortuosum exhibited neuroprotective effects in PC12 and N2a cells injured by L-glutamate or MPP+ respectively. Further­ more, identification of the pharmacologically active constituents using UPLC-qTOF-MSE revealed the presence of delta7-mesembrenone, del­ ta7-N-demethyl-mesembrenone, mesembrenone, 2-oxomesembrine, dihydrojoubertiamine, mesembrine, N-demethyl-N-formylmesem­ brenone, dihydrobuphanamine acetate, sceletenone, sceletium A4, N-methyldihydrojoubertinamine, 2-oxomesembranol, and other un­ identified constituents.

An unidentified non-alkaloid and dihydrojoubertiamine were identified in the MS profile of E1 and P5 sub-fractions. Collectively, the results of the study imply that S. tortuosum has therapeutic potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases. Also, the results indicate that there are unidentified compounds in S. tortuosum with neuroprotective potential, and these require further isolation, identification and testing for their pharmaceutical activities.

Spectra power was calculated for eight frequency ranges, viz. alpha1, alpha2, theta, beta1a, beta1b, beta 2, and gamma power. In a dose-dependent manner, Zembrin® attenuated all frequency ranges to varying degrees. Relative to electropharmacograms of the control drugs (rolipram and citicoline) and other botanical extracts, a similar electropharmacogram was obtained for Zembrin®. These results implied that Zembrin® has antidepressant, anxiolytic, and cognitive enhancing properties similar to that of control drugs.

Deionized water was used as the vehicle for imip­ ramine while deionized water and 20% Tween served as the vehicle for S. tortuosum. The results of the study showed that two doses (75 and 100 mg/kg) of S. tortuosum reduced distress vocalization rates in the chicks in the anxiety phase. However, S. tortuosum did not show any effect on distress vocalization rates in both early depression and late depression phases. The results imply that S. tortuosum has more potential in alle­ viating acute stress behaviour than chronic stress behaviour. ",

(2018) studied the effect of Zembrin® and four Zem­ brin® alkaloids (viz; mesembranol, mesembrine, mesembrenol and mesembrenone) on electric excitability of adult male Sprague-Dawlay rat’s hippocampus using the hippocampus slice model. Zembrin® was tested ex vivo, while the four alkaloid constituents were tested directly in vitro. The experimental rats were orally administered with 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of Zembrin® or control (placebo) daily for a week, and changes in the excitability of the hippocampus were checked the following day using in vitro slices. Similarly, the effects of the four Zembrin® alkaloids on population spike amplitudes were tested in vitro using two concentrations in the nanomolar range. The results of the study revealed that during the electric stimulation as single shock, as well as theta burst stimulation, Zembrin® ex vivo and Zembrin® alka­ loids in vitro attenuated the amplitude of the population spike. The study further revealed that Zembrin® and two alkaloids (mesembranol and mesembrenol) acted by attenuation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated transmission within the hippocampus. The attenuation of AMPA mediated trans­ mission has been linked to effective complementary treatment of epileptic patients. The result, therefore, implies that Zembrin®, mesembrenol and mesembrenol may serve as potential therapeutic leads that can be used in the development of drugs for treating epilepsy. ",

This dosage range was selected to coincide with the clinical literature described below. Zembrin® was compared to the se­ rotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant, escitalopram (ESC) oxalate (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg), both administered via oral gavage. Flinders Sensitive Line rats showed significant depressive-like behaviour, viz. decreased swimming and climbing (coping) behaviors, and significantly increased immobility (despair), versus Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) control rats. Escitalopram oxalate 5 mg/kg and Zembrin® at 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg showed significant dose-dependent reversal of immobility (anti-depressant effects) in FSL rats and variable effects on coping be­ haviors. Closer scrutiny found Zembrin® 50 mg/kg to be the most effective antidepressant dose, with equivalence to 5 mg/kg ESC in an associated chronic treatment study over 15 days (Gericke, 2020). However, both treatments alone did not show a significant antidepressant-like effect in the FST. The latter findings require confir­ mation and further study. That said, the combination of S. tortuosum 50 mg/kg and ESC at 5 mg/kg significantly increased hippocampal levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, as well as increased locomotor activity. Furthermore, treatment with Zembrin® (50 mg/kg alone) showed a significant increase in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The above-mentioned monoaminergic and neurotrophin effects are positive indices in major depressive disorder treatment (Brand et al., 2015), while also indicating procognitive effects and improved neuro­ plasticity, which warrants further study. That an antidepressant response to Zembrin® could only be confirmed following acute, but not chronic treatment, may be due to the model used (viz. FSL rat), advo­ cating further studies using other translational models. ",

(2020), seven medicinal plants reported in literature that are used in traditional medicine in treating anxiety and other central nervous system conditions were identified, selected and evaluated for their potential anxiolytic effects using an in vivo zebrafish assay. The plants used for the study are Xysmalobium undulatum, Withania somnifera, Sutherlandia frutescens, Sceletium tortuo­ sum, Piper methysticum, Mondia whitei and Melia azedarach. Four different crude extracts (viz: distilled water, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and methanol) of the plants were prepared, and the maximum tolerated concentration (MTC) of the extracts was determined before the anxio­ lytic activity assay. Anxiety was induced in 5-day-post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae using continuous illumination and alternating light-dark challenges. Determination of MTC values revealed that 13 of the 28 extracts tested were toxic, hence larvae were only treated with 15 non-toxic extracts at the dose that was determined in the MTC assay. Diazepam and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served as the positive and negative control, respectively. Reverse-thigmotaxis behaviour, which indicates anxiolytic activity, and general locomotor activity were analyzed in anxiety-induced zebrafish larvae. The results showed that S. tortuosum water extract of the 15 non-toxic extracts demonstrated the highest anxiolytic activity. Hence, S. tortuosum water extract was further evaluated for detailed behavioral effects. The result revealed that different tested concentrations of S. tortuosum water extract showed anxiolytic activity (reverse-thigmotaxis) on the zebrafish larvae when light-dark transitions and spontaneous locomotor activity were consid­ ered. Furthermore, during the 40 min of continuous illumination chal­ lenge, S. tortuosum water extract showed significant anxiolytic activity at two concentrations (12.5 and 25 mg/L; P < 0.01, P < 0.05 respectively) on the zebrafish larvae when compared with the control group (DMSO treated group). Collectively, the results indicate the therapeutic poten­ tials of S. tortuosum in managing anxiety. ",

The participant’s brains were scanned during performance in a perceptual-load and an emotion-matching task and exposure to fearful faces.

        "text": "It is challenging to deliver biologically active molecules into the CNS since access to the brain from the systemic blood circulation is greatly restricted by the blood-brain barrier. Typically, less than 1% of the bioavailable drug dose in the blood reaches the brain (Sonvico et al., 2018). This is also applicable to the delivery of biologically active molecules from S. tortuosum to the brain. Fortunately, the olfactory re­ gion in the nose provides a platform for direct nose-to-brain delivery of molecules and thereby avoiding the blood-brain barrier (Bahadur and Pathak, 2012). Planned research will explore the rate and extent of delivery of mesembrine alkaloids in S. tortuosum extract across excised sheep olfactory and respiratory nasal epithelial tissues. This study will indicate if the active molecules from S. tortuosum extract can be deliv­ ered rapidly and directly into the brain via the nasal route of adminis­ tration and thereby giving immediate relief (e.g. rapid treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms). After the proof of concept by these ex vivo membrane permeation studies, the delivery of S. tortuosum bio­ logically active molecules into the brain via intranasal administration should be investigated through in vivo studies.

These extracts have been extensively used in in vitro, in vivo and in clinical trials and therefore they should be used in future studies so that results can be compared. There are 25 known alkaloid com­ pounds, and it is likely that novel biologically active compounds will still be discovered. Little is known about the combined effect of these com­ pounds, which in some cases make up a large proportion of the extract. Therefore, the development of universal minimum standards for S. tortuosum extract composition with respect to selected biologically active compounds will contribute to the improvement of the quality of products when proof can be given of compliance to these minimum standards. It will also allow direct comparison of results between studies. ",

Indeed, as noted earlier, mesembrine is the most active 5-HT transport inhibitor, while mesem­ brenone is both a potent 5-HT transporter and PDE4 inhibitor. Given the inherent high mesembrine content in Trimesemine™ (˃70% mesembr­ ine), it is more potently antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in action. On the other hand, Zembrin® contains much lower levels of mesembrine but is more prominent with regard to mesembrenone, possibly affording it more pronounced effects on mood, cognition, and well-being. Taking this further, these commercial extracts, by virtue of their differences in chemotype, may offer differences in clinical utility, e.g. anxiolytic, an­ tidepressant, anti-addictive properties, etc. This is a valuable consider­ ation worth exploring in controlled clinical studies.

Current evidence in animal studies for an­ tidepressant effects are mainly based on acute challenge, which indeed is considered to translate to potential clinical efficacy. However, given that the clinical management of depression requires chronic and not acute treatment for sustained efficacy, for more translational relevance pre-clinical studies need to be undertaken using validated translational models, such as the FSL rat, using a chronic treatment regimen followed by appropriate bio-marker analysis. We have also noted earlier that differences in acute versus chronic antidepressant response, for example to Zembrin®, may be dependent on the model used, thereby advocating further studies on S. tortuosum using other translational animal models such as the chronic mild stress model. Furthermore, while the current clinical findings with S. tortuosum have been performed in healthy subjects, controlled clinical studies in a clinical population are now ur­ gently required. ",

        "text": "The prevalence of major depression grows every year and the rate of depression-related morbidity and mortality is alarming (WHO, 2017). Inadequate pharmacotherapy and increasing prevalence of resistance to current antidepressants represent a severe related health burden (WHO, 2017). Old generation groups of antidepressants such as tricyclic anti­ depressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and selec­ tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain the primary treatment for the disorder (Brand et al., 2015). Although the majority of the patient diagnosed with MDD respond well to clinical antidepressant treatment, 10–30% of patients do not improve and go on to display further symp­ toms of depression (Al-Harbi, 2012). Multiple mechanisms are impli­ cated in the pathophysiology of MDD (Brand et al., 2015). Therefore, a strategy of using antidepressants with dual-or triple action as first-line treatment, or to augment first-line treatment with agents with multi­ ple modes of action (Dupuy et al., 2011), will allow the simultaneous targeting of deficits in central brain monoamines, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroinflammation, impaired neuroplasticity, genetic predisposition, and environmental influences, among others (Brand and Harvey, 2017). Indeed, different symptoms of depression may be targeted by specifically addressing specific pathological processes in other regions of the brain, and in this way improve long-term outcomes. By virtue of its multi-mode of action (Table 3), S. tortuosum is indeed attractive as a possible augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). As noted earlier, the presence of different chemotypes of S. tortuosum are relevant here. Assessment in specific translational animal models of TRD (Brand and Harvey, 2017; Mncube et al., 2021) are recommended as proof of concept before clinical assessment. It also needs to be borne in mind that commercial availability of complementary medicines often sees herbal preparations being used without medical supervision, even in combi­ nation with prescribed treatments (Ravindran and Da Silva, 2013). This poses a serious risk for possible drug interactions and toxicity, e.g. se­ rotonin syndrome when SSRIs are co-administered with for instance Saint John’s wort (Sarris, 2018). Given the serotonergic actions of ST (Table 4) (Harvey et al., 2011), and similar supportive evidence from our laboratory (Gericke, 2020), such studies need to be undertaken. These real-world issues, plus that plant constituents may have inter­ acting effects with one another, warrant dedicated research into the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles of herbal medicines (Sarris, 2018). Such studies need to be carried out with S. tortuosum. ",

        "text": "Methamphetamine (MA) is the world’s third most abused illicit substance, after cannabis and opioids (United Nations, 2020). The consequences of MA abuse are dire, including high rates of morbidity and mortality (Herbeck et al., 2015), yet there is currently no approved treatment for MA addiction (Olsen and Liu, 2016; Shahidi et al., 2019). Its primary psychoactive and addictive effects are mediated through an increase in mesolimbic dopamine levels (Kish, 2008), through inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) (Lüscher, 2015). Moreover, MA also increases other monoamines such as noradrenaline and serotonin (Kish, 2008), through inhibition of the noradrenaline transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (SERT); (Lüscher, 2015), leading to feelings of alertness, energy, and euphoria (Panenka et al., 2013). Methamphet­ amine also influences inflammatory pathways, via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)- phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)- cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signal cascade (or cAMP-PDE4-CREB signal cascade); (Olsen and Liu, 2016), leading to a pro-inflammatory state. By displaying dual inhibitory effects on SERT and PDE4, as well as its anti-inflammatory (Loria et al., 2014), S. tortuosum may be an interesting candidate with potential in treating MA addiction. Indeed, S. tortuosum has shown concentration-dependent activity at neuronal receptors known to be involved in addiction, e.g. mu- and delta-opioid receptors (Harvey et al., 2011; Loria et al., 2014; Carpenter et al., 2016). Pre-clinical animal models of addiction may be especially suit­ able for addressing this question (Kalivas et al., 2006). These models can be specially adapted to examine S. tortuosum co-administered with MA, specifically addressing the development of addiction, or administered post MA exposure (viz. during MA withdrawal), which more explores the treatment of symptom manifestation of MA addiction. A recent an­ imal study considered whether Zembrin® could modify the behavioral and neurochemical profile of MA (Postma, 2021). The authors concluded that in this context and model, the monoaminergic actions of Zembrin® as described earlier, acts as a stimulant during MA exposure. This is not unlike the pro-dopaminergic actions of anti-addictive agents like bupropion (Postma, 2021), and hints at its possible utility as an anti-addictive agent. However, further investigation into the mechanism of action of Zembrin® during addictive states is needed, and whether it is capable of reversing psychotogenic drug-induced addictive-like behaviour.

        "text": "Recently/currently, chronic day-to-day stress has been magnified during the COVID 19 pandemic, which has negatively impacted millions of people globally (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021). Statistics revealed a seven-fold increase in major depressive disorder (MDD) in the general population during the pandemic (Bueno-Notivol et al., 2021). Evidently, these distressing statistics highlight the severity of this global disorder (Bueno-Notivol et al., 2021). The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and psychi­ atric diseases is of great concern, with an evident link between corona virus infections and various central and peripheral nervous system manifestations (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021). Unmitigated neuro-inflammation has been noted to underlie not only the severe respiratory complications of the disease but is also present in a range of neuro-psychiatric illnesses (Brand et al., 2015). Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by immune-inflammatory states, while treatments for these disorders have distinct anti-inflammatory properties and effects (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021). With inflamma­ tion being a common contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2, as well as psychiatric disorders (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021), S. tortuosum may be of interest as it has antidepressant as well as mild anti-inflammatory properties, without hindering an adequate immune response to acute immune challenges. It also exerts antiviral effects, although current evidence has focused on its potential against HIV (Bennett and Smith, 2018; Kapewangolo et al., 2016). ",
