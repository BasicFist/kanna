Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Aizoaceae is one of the largest succulent plant families. Most members of the family are ornamental and form part of specialist succulent collections. The exceptional diversity of the Aizoa­ ceae is not only limited to its growth forms, habitat, and chemistry, but is also reflected in its many traditional uses. Selected species are well known for their use in traditional medicines, with recent scientific studies vali­ dating their biological activity.

Aim of the study: Herein, this review aimed to articulate foundational and current global research endeavors related to the traditional uses and pharmacological activities of the Aizoaceae.   
Materials and methods: Research articles and search terms related to the ethnopharmacology and bioactivities of the Aizoaceae between 1940 and 2022 were evaluated using electronic databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, JSTOR, and Web of Science.   
Results: Popular Aizoaceae genera including Mesembryanthemum, Trianthema, and Tetragonia are noted for their cultural value and are key components in herbal medicines for the treatment of a myriad of disorders. Isolated bioactive compounds isolated from selected species demonstrated varied antimicrobial, antioxidant, and neu­ roprotective functions in basic pharmacological studies. However, most studies lacked reliable correlation to in vivo activity and did not adequately validate the safety and efficacy of potential therapeutic compounds. Conclusions: While the cultural and therapeutic value of popular Aizoaceae species have been highlighted in the literature, there remains glaring inconsistencies among other related species. Data deficiency may be ameliorated by further studies focused on taxonomic markers, chemical characterization and underlying molecular mecha­ nisms of activity of a wider pool of species to enhance our knowledge of this hyperdiverse family.

# 1. Introduction

The socio-economic status of many countries is a limiting factor for the provision of basic healthcare to the general population. The use of traditional remedies sourced from medicinal plants is prevalent in rural communities, mainly due to the inaccessibility, unavailability, and cost of conventional drugs (Mbuni et al., 2020). In recent times, traditional medicine has gained an increasingly large following and is often a preferred component of healthcare by both rural and urban consumers due to its integrated use with ritual and divination for comprehensive and holistic treatment (Mander et al., 2007). The use of succulents and semi-succulents in traditional and/or folk medicine is steeped in the history of many cultural systems worldwide, with information on plant use and preparation being passed down from generation to generation (Smith and Crouch, 1999). An estimated 50% of approved pharmaceutical drugs established within the last 30 years are derived directly or indirectly from botanical resources (Veeresham, 2012). Due to the growing interest in succulent plants by researchers and those in industry, a number of indigenous botanical resources have been screened and evaluated for their pharmacologically important phyto­ compounds (Street and Prinsloo, 2013).

The Aizoaceae, which constitutes one of the largest succulent fam­ ilies of the Angiosperms, represents a currently underexplored source of potential therapeutic compounds, despite the evidence of some mem­ bers being used extensively in traditional medicine practices to treat a myriad of health conditions. Moreover, despite growing ethnobotanical and scientific research in recent decades, we have only begun the journey to validate the therapeutic activity of this family. Thus, this review seeks to comprehensively outline the global cultural and tradi­ tional uses of the Aizoaceae as well as evaluate the biological activity and pharmacological potential of representative members that occur worldwide.

# 2. Methods

The current research endeavor included a wide variety of interna­ tional and local literature sources to comprehensively evaluate foun­ dational and recent information focusing on the global ethnopharmacology, traditional uses, and pharmacological activities of the hyperdiverse Aizoaceae. To this end, full-length research and review articles, in vivo and in vitro studies, dissertations, and clinical studies, obtained from international databases such as Google Scholar, JSTOR, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, were included in this extensive review on global Aizoaceae species. A combination of specific keywords related to the ethnopharmacology and biological ac­ tivities of Aizoaceae whole plants, extracts, and products were used. Additionally, search terms related to the traditional and cultural uses of species were included either individually or in combination with pharmacology-related terms. Letters and conference proceedings were excluded, as well as data obtained prior to 1940. The literature review search was initially confined to the period between 2000 and 2022 and focused on the most recent articles. However, due to data deficiency, fragmented research records, and the fact that research on this family was primarily conducted during the period 1940–1999, several earlier articles that were pertinent to the review were also included. Scientific names of plant species included the authority at first mention and were screened for any updated changes according to The International Plant Names Index (IPNI) (IPNI, 2022) and cross-referenced with “World Flora Online” (WFO) [(WFO, 2022); previously theplantlist.org]. Compre­ hensive taxonomic delimitations are beyond the scope of the current review, thus scientific names have been retained as cited in reviewed publications for cross-referencing purposes. However, where possible, alternate, newly revised, or previously accepted scientific names (basionyms) for certain species have been included.

# 3. Distribution and general characteristics

The Aizoaceae include at least 130 recognized genera and approxi­ mately 2000 species occupying diverse subtropical and tropical habitats worldwide (Fig. 1). Despite their wide range, the majority of species are endemic to the southern Africa region, especially the Succulent Karoo biome. However, approximately 25 genera and around 90 species can be found naturalized or introduced to parts of Australasia and the Americas (Morris and Duretto, 2009), wherein they are regarded as weeds. There are reports of Lampranthus in Portugal (Smith et al., 2018), Carpobrotus across the Mediterranean islands (Fenollosa and Munne´-Bosch, 2019) and Tetragonia in Chile and Argentina (Taylor, 1994). The Aizoaceae contain annual and perennial succulent herbs and shrubs, rarely trees. Despite a plethora of diverse leaf forms, defining characters of the family include the hygrochastic fruiting capsule, perianth stamen tube and bladder cells which account for the numerous common names associated with these plants (Klak et al., 2003). The light reflective capacity of bladder cells embedded in the foliage is the basis for the common name “ice plant”, whilst the South African Afrikaans vernacular term “vygies” meaning “little fig” is used due to the resemblance of the fruit capsule to a tiny fig.

# 4. Taxonomy

The succulent Aizoaceae form a major family within the Car­ yophyllales and can be divided sensu stricto into five sub-families including Aizooideae, Mesembryanthemoideae, Ruschioideae, Sesu­ vioideae and Tetragonioideae (Hassan et al., 2005). Studies to date have not wholly resolved the debate concerning relationships among these sub-families, with some groups regarded as distinct families (Klak et al., 2013). In fact, Mesembryanthemaceae is frequently used by many re­ searchers to refer to members of the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae (Klak et al., 2003) and are colloquially regarded as “mesembs’. Despite the apparent richness and hyperdiversity of the Aizoaceae, there is significant data deficiency pertaining to the majority of taxa. Even within the various sub-families, many genera are being revised and re-circumscribed as new molecular and morphological data becomes available. For instance, the Mesembryanthemoideae previously contained many genera including Sceletium, until Klak et al. (2017) provided a revised phylogeny of the sub-family, which resulted in recognition of Mesembryanthemum as the sole genus within the Mesembryanthemoideae and members of Sceletium, Aptenia, Phyllobolus, and Psilocaulon (among others) being reduced to synonymy (Brendler et al., 2021). Von Staden et al. (2013) indicated that at least 55% of taxa in the Aizoaceae require taxonomic revision. Classification discrep­ ancies at species and genera level and rapid evolutionary radiation further add to delimitation woes. In terms of this review, all taxa mentioned are classified under the currently accepted Aizoaceae (Bit­ trich and Hartmann, 1988; Klak et al., 2003; Klak et al., 2017).

# 5. Traditional medicinal uses

Notable ethnomedicinal uses of members of the Aizoaceae have been documented (Table 1). Among the plant parts used, the leaves and roots appear in various preparatory forms with herbal formulations primarily ingested as juices and decoctions. Decoctions are known to be the most common route of administration, possibly due to its perceived quick absorption and potent action (Yang, 2010). Aizoaceae plants have been used to treat a variety of ailments due to their sedative, analgesic, and antimicrobial activity, amongst others. Hypertension and respiratory, digestive, neurological, and cardiac (to a lesser extent) conditions have been alleviated by traditional remedies derived from plants of the Aizoaceae. The medicinal value of genera such as Mesembryanthemum, Trianthema and Tetragonia appear to be more widely represented in comparison to others. However, there are many limitations in validating and obtaining reliable conclusions regarding the overall medicinal po­ tential of the Aizoaceae. Much of the earlier literature does not confirm the species used in many reports. Scientific identification of medicinal species may have been hampered by the similar plant morphology shared by different species; whilst some species exhibit varied morphology within the same genus. Further complications arise due to incorrect classification within the family. Genera such as Gisekia, Glinus and Mollugo, previously included in Aizoaceae, have since been redis­ tributed to their own distinct families. As a result, some published research conducted on these species have incorrectly linked ethnobo­ tanical and pharmacological use to other members of the Aizoaceae based on perceived relatedness (Napagoda et al., 2016). Thus, there is still much to learn regarding the traditional uses of this family.

# 6. Cultural uses

# 6.1. Rituals and divination

Plants of the Aizoaceae have been utilized by many cultural and ethnic groups for the purposes of divination and ritual, to ameliorate ancestral wrath, and to communicate with the ancestors for guidance to diagnose and treat medical conditions. IsiZulu warriors of South Africa added the ground plant material of Delosperma saturatum L. Bolus to a mix of various other unknown plants (called intelezi in the IsiZulu lan­ guage) in water, which was used for cleansing and washing of weapons prior to battle. It was believed to provide “powers” to pre-empt the enemies plan (Burgoyne, 2005). Bergeranthus artus, another constituent of intelezi, is also used as a protective charm (Dold et al., 2005). The indigenous people of southern Africa, the Khoisan, used pulverized Mesembryanthemum tortuosum L. N.E.Br (syn. Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N. E.Br) as an intoxicant called “kanna” during various divination rituals as well as communal dance and healing ceremonies (Smith et al., 1996). The Nama people, an ethnic derivative of the Khoikhoi, used Mesem­ bryanthemum spp. (syn. Sceletium spp.) as a narcotic leading to euphoria and heightened sexual desire (Ratsch, 2005).

Many of the Aizoaceae were used in the manufacture of aphrodisiacs and love charms to secure or break relationships. Indigenous African tribes employed Aptenia cordifolia (L.f.) Schwantes (now Mesembryan­ themum cordifolium) as a love charm and protection against witchcraft (van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). In the case of Lithops lesliei N.E.Br., its physical resemblance to female genitalia supported its inclusion in charms to recall “lost love” and as a remedy for gynecological disorders (Smith and Crouch, 1999). In Andean culture, Tetragonia crystallina L’He´r., colloquially known as “Hierba de la Se˜norita” formed part of a collection of plants and perfumes used in the preparation of a “ba˜no de florecimiento” (flowering bath) or “seguros” (herbal talisman), created to protect the user against evil and bring good fortune and health (Buss­ mann et al., 2010).

# 6.2. Food and beverage

The Bedouin and Tuareg nomadic inhabitants of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula consume parts of Mesembryanthemum spp. (Mesem­ bryanthemum forskahlii, Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum L., and

Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.) and Aizoon canariense L. The green leaves are consumed as a cooked vegetable or included in a salad, whilst the seeds are ground and used in the preparation of porridge and soup, especially in times of famine (Mandaville, 2019; O¨ ztürk et al., 2019). In parts of south-east Asia, Australia, and New Zealand the tangy leaves of Tetragonia tetragonioides (Pall.) Kuntze, Disphyma crassifolium (L.) L. Bolus and Trianthema portulacastrum L. are used as a spinach substitute and eaten raw or cooked (Gaddeyya and Ratna Kumar, 2015). Several of the Aizoaceae are known for their edible fruits including the Australian endemic Sarcozona sp. and many Carpobrotus spp. [C. acinaciformis (L.) L.Bolus, C. edulis (L.) N.E.Br., C. mellei (L.Bolus) L.Bolus, C. deliciosus (L. Bolus) L.Bolus, C. dimidiatus L.Bolus] (Broomhead et al., 2019; Kapitany, 2013). Carpobrotus sp. are eaten raw or dried and used in the preparation of fruit preserves and jams in South Africa (Springfield et al., 2003). Welcome and van Wyk (2019) outline many Aizoaceae genera that are used for human consumption as vegetables or snacks in South Africa, including lesser-known species such as Aizoon glinoides Eckl. & Zeyh., Conophytum truncatum (Thunb.) N.E.Br., Cleretum papulosum (L.f.) N.E. Br., Nananthus aloides Schwantes, and Pleiospilos nelii Schwantes. In the southern African region, many Aizoaceae species are used by local and indigenous people to make alcoholic beverages; either as an ingredient [Bergeranthus spp.; Khadia acutipetala (N.E.Br.) N.E.Br.; Glottiphyllum linguiforme N.E.Br.; Rhus lancea L.f.; Trichodiadema intonsum (Haw.) Schwantes; Delosperma mahonia (N.E. Br.) N.E. Br.] or for fermentation purposes (Mesembryanthemum spp. Delosperma spp. and Trichodiadema stellatum Schwantes) (Dold et al., 2005; Onderstall, 2007; Welcome and van Wyk, 2019). Plant parts of Khadia, Mestoklema and Trichodiadema spp. are used as a leavening agent when making bread.

In addition to humans, animals favour the succulent, arid species of the Aizoaceae. For example, Mesembryanthemum cryptanthum Hook.f. (syn. M. forskahlii) is a popular forage plant, whilst the aerial parts of A. canariense are specially fed to female camels of the Sahrawi nomads to increase milk production (Volpato and Puri, 2014). In parts of Central and South Africa, and Australia, many individual species of Drosanthe­ mum are popular grazing plants and are highly palatable to domestic livestock (Haarmeyer et al., 2010), whilst Ruschia robusta Schwantes has been known to be semi-palatable (Nenzhelele, 2017). Conversely, Tri­ anthema, Tetragonia and Galenia spp. contain high levels of toxic oxa­ lates, which causes poisoning in poultry, cattle, and horses (Burrows and Tyrl, 2013). Ingestion of Galenia spp. by sheep and goats may result in the development of ascites, a condition known colloquially as “water­ pens” (water belly) in the Western Cape province of South Africa (Botha and Penrith, 2008). Interestingly, some livestock are sufficiently knowledgeable in that they avoid the young and green plants and forage on the dry, older plants that presumably contain lower, more tolerable levels of oxalate.

# 6.3. Miscellaneous uses

Mesembryanthemum noctiflorum L., Galenia africana L., Polymita albi­ flora (L.Bolus) L.Bolus and Stoeberia arborea van Jaarsv. are some species known for their usefulness as firewood (van Jaarsveld, 2005; Wheat, 2013; Nortje and van Wyk, 2019) whilst Ruschia spp. has been used by the Nama indigenous people to build cooking shelters (Wheat, 2013). In New Zealand, the red juice of T. tetragonioides berries are used by the Ma¯ori people as ink and dye for tattoos (Burton, 2012). However, the majority of Aizoaceae species are used as ornamentals or in the horti­ culture industry. The vibrant, distinctly colourful flowers of Carpobrotus, Frithia and Erepsia and the quirky, unusual shape of Faucaria, Lithops, Conophytum and Gibbaeum make them prized pot plants and succulent collector items.

steroids, and their related intermediary compounds in the Aizoaceae is concentrated on select species and interspersed throughout the years. Notably, mesembrine alkaloids were earlier isolated from Mesem­ bryathemum spp. (syn. Sceletium spp.) (Smith et al., 1996) with renewed interest in later publications focusing on mesembrine-type alkaloid de­ rivatives such as mesembranol, mesembrenol, and mesembrenone (Harvey et al., 2011; Krstenansky, 2017). Of interest are the chro­ moalkaloids, betacyanin and betaxanthin (collectively called betalains), which are plant pigments specific to the Caryophyllales and used as synthetic dye replacements. Betanin pigments such as 2-Descarboxy-be­ tanidin and Lampranthin I and II were isolated from C. acinaciformis and Lampranthus spp. respectively. Noteworthy betalain content was detec­ ted in the flowers of Erepsia spp., Smicrostigma viride N.E.Br., Glottiphy­ lum spp. and Lampranthus productus N.E.Br. (Khan and Giridhar, 2015). Phytochemical evaluation and screening of betalains represents a po­ tential research focus as they are known to exhibit antioxidant, anti­ cancer and anti-inflammatory activity (Gandía-Herrero et al., 2016). While iridoids have yet to be confirmed in the Aizoaceae, a novel, antifungal tetraterpenoid, trianthenol 1 was isolated from the chloro­ form extract of T. portulacastrum (Nawaz et al., 2001) as well as ecdys­ terone, a potential chemosterilant (Sukalingam et al., 2017). Phytosterols such as sitosterol and stigmasterol were isolated from the ethanol extract of the aerial part of A. cordifolia. The presence of beta-sitosterol and campesterol in the seed oil of M. forskalii implied its usefulness in attenuating high cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases (Bilel et al., 2020) while the isolated steroidal compound, pentandraol, isolated from Zaleya pentandra (L.) C.Jeffrey was implicated in the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the extract. A novel lignan N-2, 3-dihydroxy-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenol) tyramine was isolated from the aerial regions of Tetragonia tetragonoides (Pall.) Kuntze, (Choi et al., 2019). Flavonoids including flavones, flavonols, flavanones, chalcones, and proanthocyanidins have been detected in at least 14 genera of the Aizoaceae. Kaempferol (3,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) and/or quercetin was commonly isolated in members of Mesembryanthemum, Lithops, Lampranthus, and Conophytum (Iwashina, 2015). Recently, Abuzaid et al. (2020) identified a novel kaempferol derivative, kaempfer­ ol-3-O-(2’’-O–βD-glucopyranosyl)-6’’-O-E-feruloyl–βD-glucopyranoside­ D-glucopyranosyl)-6’’-O-E-feruloyl-β-D-glucopyranoside in T. portulaca strum. Proanthocyanidins containing cyanidin were identified in the unripe seeds of Sesuvium portulacastrum (L.) L., A. glinoides, A. cordifolia and T. tetragonioides (Bittrich and Amaral, 1991). Other specific phar­ macological effects of the Aizoaceae are discussed further.

# 7.1. Central and nervous system (CNS)

The activity of psychoactive plants can be attributed to phyto­ compounds involved in sedative or calming, hallucinogenic, and/or stimulatory effects (Alrashedy and Molina, 2016). Many psychoactive species of Sceletium/Mesembryanthemum are widely recognized for their efficacy against multiple CNS conditions. Perhaps one of the most popular poster plants for the treatment of neurological and psycholog­ ical disorders, M. tortuosum (S. tortuosum) has been extensively studied for its anxiolytic properties, and usefulness in attenuating cognitive decline (Smith et al., 1996; Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Patnala and Kanfer, 2013; Krstenansky, 2017; Brendler et al., 2021). The efficacy of the plant extract in both in vitro and in vivo clinical trials has been attributed to its alkaloid content, specifically the phytocompound, mesembrine and related mesembrine derivatives such as mesembrenol, mesembrenone, mesembranol and epimesembranol (Patnala and Kan­ fer, 2017; Brendler et al., 2021). These compounds are currently being used in commercially available pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dementia due to their effectiveness as potent serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in maintaining neurochemical homeostasis (Krstenansky, 2017; Makolo et al., 2019; Brendler et al., 2021). Mesembrine and/or its derivatives are present in related genera of the Aizoaceae including Lampranthus, Bergeranthus, Delosperma, Drosanthemum, Glottiphyllum, Oscularia, and Ruschia, albeit in varying minimal amounts (Smith et al., 1998).

Serotonergic hallucinogens such as tryptamines and tryptamine de­ rivatives - N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and 5-MeO-DMT/5- methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine have been shown to induce mood changes, euphoria and provide the user with an altered or distorted view of objects and reality (Schifano et al., 2016). These compounds have been found to occur at high levels in many Delosperma spp. Studies show that other plants, such as A. cordifolia, Plinthus sericeus Pax and Psilo­ caulon coriarium N.E.Br (previously known as Psilocaulon absimile N.E.Br, now also known as Mesembryanthemum coriarium) contain appreciable levels of currently unidentified alkaloids which may be of therapeutic value (Said et al., 2019; Smith et al., 1998) and thus serve as a potential

avenue of future research.

A few studies have highlighted the efficacy of Aizoaceae extracts in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. The dichloro­ methane crude extract and currently unidentified compound GA2 from G. africana inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity (Phungula et al., 2014). Silver nanoparticles synthesized from the aqueous extract of Lampranthus coccineus (Haw.) N.E.Br. (LC) and Malephora lutea (Haw.) Schwantes (ML) showed greater acetylcholinesterase inhibition in comparison to crude aqueous extracts (LC: 0.82 ± 0.03 ng/mL vs. 1.23 0.01 ng/mL, ML: 1.36  0.01 ng/mL vs. 1.95  0.01 ng/mL) despite poor activity against the standard drug Rivastigmine (0.79 ± 0.01 ng/mL, p < 0.05) (Youssif et al., 2019). The leaves of C. edulis showed an affinity to treat cognitive impairment due to the AChE- and BuChE-inhibitory activity of their dichloromethane and methanol ex­ tracts (Rocha et al., 2017). However, the fruit peel of C. edulis demon­ strated little to no acetylcholinesterase activity (Castan˜eda-Loaiza et al., 2020).

# 7.2. Antimicrobial activity

Many members of the Aizoaceae have been used as part of traditional medicine practices for the treatment of infections and related microbial diseases. This has led to the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a select few plants (Table 2). Various conventional methods, such as disc or agar diffusion and microdilution assays have been used for the pre­ liminary screening of plants with potential microbial-inhibitory effects. Whilst most studies indicated broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, gram-positive bacteria in comparison to gram-negative bacteria, appeared to have greater susceptibility to the bactericidal and inhibitory effects of Aizoaceae plant extracts and oils. This may be attributed to the lipopolysaccharide-enriched outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that serve as a permeability barrier to antimicrobial agents. Interest­ ingly, many studies have focused on the identification and isolation of specific compounds or secondary metabolites involved in microbial in­ hibition. For example, Nawaz et al. (2001) isolated an antifungal tri­ terpenoid, Trianthenol 1 from the chloroform extract of T. portulacastrum. Neubauerova´ et al. (2011) isolated low molecular weight peptides from the leaves of T. tetragonioides which demonstrated moderate antimicrobial activity, detected by a 9 mm and 7 mm inhibi­ tion zone, against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. In a study by Ticha et al. (2015), two compounds, a flavonoid ((S)-5,7-dihydroxy-2′-methoxyflavanone) and a chalcone ((E)-2-hydroxy-3′,6′-dimethoxychalcone) were isolated from the leaves of G. africana. The latter compound presented a MIC99 of 5 μM against Mycobacterium tuberculosis necessitating further investigation of the chalcone as an effective antimycobacterial compound. In another study evaluating the antituberculotic activity of flavonoids isolated from G. africana leaves by Mativandlela et al. (2009), the synergistic combi­ nation of (2S)-5,7,2′-trihydroxyflavanone, isolated from the ethanolic fraction, and an existing antituberculotic drug, isoniazid, reduced the initial minimum inhibitory concentration 16-fold against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further studies would be required to fully evaluate the combined effects and potential toxicity of these compounds in in vivo models.

The use of Carpobrotus spp. (most commonly C. edulis and C. acinaciformis) for the traditional treatment of oral infections, insect bites, and toothache is well documented in southern Africa (Springfield et al., 2003; van Wyk et al., 2008). As a result, there are numerous studies evaluating the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of C. edulis crude extracts and isolated fractions against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms (van der Watt and Pretorius, 2001; Springfield and Weitz, 2006; Ibtissem et al., 2012). This activity has been attributed to various flavonoids, such as rutin, hyperoside, neohesperidin, catechin and ferulic acid, and tannins isolated from the plant (van der Watt and Pretorius, 2001). The crude leaf extracts of Carpobrotus muirii L.Bolus, C. mellei, and Carpobrotus quadrifidus L.Bolus also showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis in the disc diffusion assay (Springfield et al., 2003; Springfield and Weitz, 2006). Interestingly, the authors pointed out that C. edulis and C. mellei were morphologically congruent to each other and wide­ spread in the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is surmised that these species may have potentially been utilized interchangeably in traditional medicine preparations. However, Akhalwaya et al. (2018) evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of 139 South African me­ dicinal plants and found that the dichloromethane extract of C. edulis showed noteworthy activity for only one out of nine tested oral patho­ gens (Fusobacterium nucleatum, MIC: 0.50 mg/mL). According to existing ethnobotanical literature, traditional healers utilize water and alcohol decoctions derived from the aerial parts and roots of Carpobrotus spp. to treat fungal and HIV-related infections (Otang et al., 2012). However, the aqueous and ethanol extracts were inactive against various strains of Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans in comparison to the antibi­ otics, Nystatin and Amphotericin B (Springfield et al., 2003; Omoruyi, 2014). Subsequently, C. edulis was disregarded as a hospital and home-care remedy for the treatment of oral candidiasis affecting HIV patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Motsei et al., 2003). Moreover, fungal growth was promoted, like that of C. albicans and C. krusei in the aqueous extracts of Lampranthus francisci L.Bolus (Moyo and Mukanga­ nyama, 2015). It is important to note that solvent polarity and the extract concentration may affect antifungal activity as herbal practi­ tioners often prescribe remedies in multiple doses, prepared via different methods and which may, or may not contain other plant extracts derived from various plant organs (Omoruyi, 2014).

# 7.3. Antioxidant activity

Oxidative stress occurs when reactive oxygen species (ROS) pro­ duction exceeds intrinsic antioxidant mechanisms, resulting in cell damage and degradation of macromolecules, which further leads to chronic and degenerative diseases such as diabetes, cardio-vascular conditions, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders (Szymanska et al., 2016). Current research trends indicate the effectiveness of exogenous antioxidants, especially plant-derived extracts, or com­ pounds, for free radical scavenging, chelation of transition metals, and inhibition of peroxidation. The in vitro antioxidant activity of some members of the Aizoaceae is outlined in Table 3. Most studies utilized the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay to determine the antioxidant capacity of selected samples. Whilst no single method can comprehensively describe and evaluate the mechanism of action of antioxidants in vitro, the DPPH assay is useful for the pre­ liminary screening of plants with free radical scavenging capabilities and identification of novel compounds with antioxidant value.

Oxidative stress is one of the primary mechanisms that facilitates the progression of HIV to AIDS and increases patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections (Kapewangolo et al., 2016). Some members of the Aizoaceae have demonstrated significant antioxidant activity and have been indirectly implicated in reducing the viral load in infected individuals. For example, Omoruyi et al. (2012) identified significant radical scavenging activity in C. edulis extracts (DPPH IC50 of aqueous and ethanolic extract: 0.018 mg/mL and 0.016 mg/mL respectively, p < 0.05) thereby supporting the traditional use of the plant in managing HIV and AIDS related infections. The ethanol and ethyl acetate crude extracts of M. tortuosum (S. tortuosum) were found to inhibit HIV-1 en­ zymes, reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR). Both extracts demonstrated values of IC50 < 50 μg/mL and IC50 < 100 μg/mL for RT and PR inhibition respectively, suggesting further monitoring of M. tortuosum (S. tortuosum) as a potential therapeutic agent (Kape­ wangolo et al., 2016).

Many halophytic members of the Aizoaceae have demonstrated enhanced ROS scavenging as an adaptive mechanism in response to abiotic stresses. Noteworthy examples include M. crystallinum (Agarie et al., 2009) and Trianthema triquetra Willd. ex Spreng (Sharma and a Plant names include accepted authorities (at first mention) and synonyms (in parentheses) where available.

Ramawat, 2014) which exhibited increased antioxidant activity in response to elevated levels of NaCl. In addition, there was a corre­ sponding increase in the production of polyols and phenolic compounds, which are recognized as osmoregulants and potent natural antioxidants respectively (Agarie et al., 2009). Phenolic compounds are significant contributors to the radical scavenging capability in many Aizoaceae species. For example, high levels of polyphenolics in M. crystallinum and M. nodiflorum extracts correlated to greater antioxidant activity (Hanen et al., 2009). Similar results were obtained with C. edulis (Omoruyi et al., 2012) and C. rossi (Geraghty et al., 2011).

In addition to biological and environmental factors, the choice of solvents for chemical extraction affects phenolic content and antioxi­ dant activity. For instance, the methanolic extract of M. edule (C. edulis) contained higher levels of polyphenols than the ethanolic extract (Ksouri et al., 2008). Whilst there are a plethora of preliminary studies assessing the in vitro antioxidant activity of Aizoaceae extracts, few, if any, have evaluated the in vivo effects. Consideration must be given to the fact that significant in vitro antioxidant activity does not necessarily pre-empt in

vivo activity.

# 7.4. Cosmetic use

Traditional methods have seen the incorporation of plant extracts into poultices, lotions, and topical ointments for the treatment of a va­ riety of skin ailments including aging, inflammation, and pigmentation (Mabona and van Vuuren, 2013). Moreover, the cosmetic industry has seen a shift in consumer demand toward more eco-friendly and natural treatments, with many recent skin care products being supplemented with plant extracts (Lall and Kishore, 2014). Members of the Aizoaceae that display wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimi­ crobial, antimutagenic and anti-aging properties, can be used to alle­ viate the effects of various skin conditions (De Beer and van Wyk, 2011; Martins et al., 2011). For example, C. edulis, used traditionally as an antiseptic and astringent against itching, insect bites and wounds has shown to exhibit antioxidant and antibacterial activity (Falleh et al., 2012; Ibtissem et al., 2012). This served as the basis of its use in a commercial patent as a cosmetic agent to enhance skin brightness and texture (Laperdrix et al., 2013). Kim et al. (2017) related the use of M. crystallinum alcohol extracts to delays in skin cell aging and enhanced skin whitening. Additionally, ferulic acid isolated from T. tetragonioides, has been evaluated for its whitening effect and anti-wrinkle activity on mouse melanoma cell lines and human dermal fibroblast cell lines respectively (Park et al., 2018).

Of interest was the detection of gamma linolenic acid (GLA), a fatty acid found primarily in seed oils, at appreciable levels in the leaves of A. canariense (Freije et al., 2013). Gamma linolenic acid is widely used as a homeopathic remedy for inflammatory skin conditions such as psori­ asis and eczema. Additionally, the appreciable inhibitory effect of M. forskahlii seed oil extract on P. chysogenum and A. fumigatus under­ pinned its usefulness for the treatment of fungal infections of the scalp and hair (Bilel et al., 2020). The increasing prevalence of botanical derived skin care products requires further scientific and clinical exploration. Health and safety implications should be a significant consideration when evaluating the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of plant extracts on dermatological conditions.

# 7.5. Cytotoxicity/anti-cancer agents

Due to the high incidence and aggressive nature of many cancers globally, it has become imperative to evaluate plants and naturally derived products to ameliorate current cancer strategies. There is growing evidence of the use of plant-derived compounds for adjuvant treatment during chemo- and radio-therapy as well as for their anti­ mutagenic and antitumorigenic activity. The anti-cancer potential of the ethanolic and chloroform fractions of T. portulacastrum was evaluated in n-diethylnitrosoamine (DENA)-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis (Bhattacharya and Chatterjee, 1999) and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthra­ cene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary tumorigenesis models (Mandal and Bishayee, 2015). In the earlier study, a marked reduction in the size and distribution of nodules and liver focal lesions was observed, with no apparent toxic side-effects. T. portulacastrum suppressed (DMBA)-ini­ tiated mammary tumor incidence without any toxicity due to the regulation of NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways involved in inflam­ mation responses.

Efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein are known to confer multidrug resistance to cancer by extruding chemotherapy drugs as well as other drugs to which cancers have become refractory (resistant). Currently, compounds used to block these efflux pumps are toxic at active levels and may lead to increased cancer risk overall. However, a study con­ ducted by Martins et al. (2010) demonstrated the antiproliferative ac­ tivity of the chloroform and ethyl acetate soluble fractions from C. edulis on mouse lymphoma cell lines. All isolated compounds, especially Uvaol, were effective in the reversal of multidrug resistance in cancer and displayed no toxicity at concentrations evaluated in the study. Whilst this basic study supports the potential use of plant derived compounds to indirectly supplement anti-cancer therapies, much research is required to evaluate the chemo-preventative efficacy of such compounds in humans.

Other members of the Aizoaceae that have demonstrated promising anti-carcinogenic and immunomodulatory effects include Z. pentandra (Mughal et al., 2020) and Trianthema decandra L. (Gajjala et al., 2019) extracts against breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7, and M. crystallinum against HCT116 human colon cancer cells (Seo and Ju, 2019). The cytotoxic potential of T. portulacastrum and A. canariense fractions against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines was evaluated by Abuzaid et al. (2020), with noteworthy cytotoxic ac­ tivity of the n-hexane and n-butanol extracts of A. canariense (24.7  3.5 and 55.3 ± 4.9 μg/mL, respectively). Conversely, M. nodiflorum did not exhibit any significant cytotoxic activity on breast cancer (MCF7) and cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells, at concentrations ranging from 31.25 to 1000 μg/mL (p > 0.05) (Doudach et al., 2013). Furthermore, mesembrenone isolated from M. tortuosum (S. tortuosum) and cannabidiol from Cannabis sativa were tested for their anti-cancer ac­ tivity against three breast cancer cell lines, MCF12A, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. Unfortunately, not only did mesembrenone show insig­ nificant activity against the three cancer cell lines in comparison to cannabidiol, but it also demonstrated high levels of toxicity in healthy breast cells at all tested concentrations, which could not be alleviated by co-treatment with cannabidiol (Tunstall, 2019).

# 7.6. Other pharmacological activities

Moawad et al. (2020) evaluated the acaricidal activity of T. portulacastrum L. and A. canariense against Rhipicephalus annulatus tick using adult and larval immersion tests at increasing concentrations. While the crude hydroalcoholic extract of T. portulacastrum demon­ strated 100% adult and larval mortality, A. canariense did not show appreciable acaricidal effects (<25% adult and larval mortality, p 0.05). The anthelminthic activity of the aqueous methanolic extract of T. decandra Linn. against female Haemonchus contortus and their eggs was assessed by Hussain et al. (2011). Significant anthelmintic activity (p < 0.05) on live worms as well as egg hatching was noted.

Various ethanolic extracts of M. tortuosum (S. tortuosum) were eval­ uated for their anti-malarial activity and three extracts demonstrated potent in vitro anti-malarial activity against a chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum strain (Setshedi et al., 2012). The methanol extract of T. portulacastrum and Zaleya decandra (L.) Burm.f. roots pro­ duced dose-dependent hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and anti­ hyperglycemic activity in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, which was comparable to a standard oral hypoglycemic agent, glibenclamide (Anreddy et al., 2010; Meenakshi et al., 2010).

# 8. Conclusion and future research

The present review evaluated the traditional uses and pharmaco­ logical activities of representative members of the Aizoaceae. Most species are used as ornamentals and form part of specialist succulent collections. The traditional uses of popular genera such as Mesembry­ anthemum, Sesuvium, Trianthema and Carpobrotus are well documented in South African and Indian traditional medicine systems for their an­ tidepressant, anxiolytic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxi­ dant effects. However, few scientific studies have comprehensively validated their clinical efficacy or safety. Lesser-known genera like Ruschia, Lithops and Delosperma have been used in traditional medicine, especially in the southern Africa region, without any significant scien­ tific validation of therapeutic activity. Hence, isolation and chemical characterization of therapeutic compounds of interest are a potential research focus for further studies. It was noted that the taxonomic dis­ crepancies within the family add to existing confusion regarding species delimitation and reliable evaluation of most taxa. For this reason, evi­ dence of biological activity based on species relatedness should be carefully reviewed. Moreover, incorrect and/or duplicated species nomenclature, and morphological changes which have contributed to the taxonomic irregularities within the Aizoaceae may be resolved by future studies focusing on genomic analyses and chemotaxonomic markers. It is apparent that the findings of most studies on the Aizoaceae are inconsistent and cannot be used to make accurate conclusions regarding the family. Moreover, a sparse number of publications in recent years have comprehensively addressed the ethnobotany, phar­ macognosy and chemical constituents of the hyperdiverse Aizoaceae, thus these focus areas are worthy of further investigation.
