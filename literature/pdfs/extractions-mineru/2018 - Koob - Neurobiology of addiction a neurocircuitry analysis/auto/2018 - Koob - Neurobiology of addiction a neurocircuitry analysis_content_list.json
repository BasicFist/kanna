The rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, development of incentive salience, and development of drug-seeking habits in the binge/ intoxication stage involve changes in dopamine and opioid peptides in the basal ganglia. The increases in negative emotional states and dysphoric and stress-like responses in the withdrawal/ negative affect stage involve decreases in the function of the dopamine component of the reward system and recruitment of brain stress neurotransmitters, such as corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin, in the neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala. The craving and deficits in executive function in the so-called preoccupation/anticipation stage involve the dysregulation of key afferent projections from the prefrontal cortex and insula, including glutamate, to the basal ganglia and extended amygdala. Molecular genetic studies have identified transduction and transcription factors that act in neurocircuitry associated with the development and maintenance of addiction that might mediate initial vulnerability, maintenance, and relapse associated with addiction.

First, we aim to elaborate a heuristic framework based on the neuropsychopharmacological and brain imaging phenotype of addiction in the context of three functional domains (incentive salience, negative emotional states, and executive function) mediated by three major neuro-biological circuits (basal ganglia, extended amygdala, and prefrontal cortex). Second, we aim to identify neurochemically defined mini circuits that can independently or interactively mediate functional neuroplasticity within the three major circuits to produce incentive salience and compulsivelike habits, negative emotional states of low reward and excessive stress, and compromised executive function. Building on previous identification of the three overall domains, this Review provides a framework for integration of the ever-expanding neuroplastic complexity of motivational systems that are involved in addiction and for identification of new targets for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of addiction.

However, impulsivity and compulsivity can coexist, and frequently do so in the different stages of the addiction cycle.8 ",

Although no animal model of addiction fully emulates the human condition, they permit investigations of specific signs or symptoms that are associated with the psychopathological condition. If the model adequately mimics the phenomenology observed in humans as they transition from experimentation to addiction, then it is more likely to have construct or predictive validity.11 The phenomena under study can be models of different systems (genetic, epigenetic, transcription, cellular, and network), psychological constructs (positive and negative reinforcement), symptoms outlined by psychiatric nosology (craving, hypohedonia, and dysphoria), and stages of the addiction cycle.4 Recently developed animal models take advantage of individual and strain diversity in responses to drugs, incorporate complex environments with access to and choices of alternative reinforcers, and test effects of stressful stimuli, allowing the investigation of neuro biological processes that underlie the risk for addiction and environmental factors that provide resilience against vulnerability. Animal models have also started to explore the influence of developmental stage and sex in drug response to better understand the greater vulnerability to substance use disorders when drug use is initiated in adolescence, and the distinct drug use trajectories that are observed in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms involved in the stages of the addiction cycle can be conceptualised as domains, with a focus on specific brain circuits, the molecular and neurochemical changes in those circuits during the transition from drug taking to addiction, and the way in which those changes persist in the vulnerability to relapse.12 Equally convincing, animal models of the specific stages of the addiction cycle can be paralleled by human laboratory models13 and studied with neuroimaging.14 ",

This line of investigation is fundamental because changes to how the drug-induced reward system is activated are key to the understanding of the development of addiction.4 Reward is defined herein as any event that increases the probability of a response with a positive hedonic component. A principal focus of research on the neurobiology of the rewarding effects of abused drugs has been the origins and terminal areas of the ascending mesocorticostriatal dopamine systems that have a key role in the rewarding properties of nearly all drugs of abuse (table 1).34 In humans, positron emission tomography studies have shown that intoxicating doses of alcohol and drugs release dopamine and opioid peptides into the ventral striatum,16,35 and that fast and steep release of dopamine is associated with the subjective sensation of the so-called high.36 This is because fast and steep increases in dopamine activate low-affi nity dopamine D1 receptors, which are necessary for the rewarding effects of drugs37 and for triggering conditioned responses.38 By contrast, dopamine stimulation of high-affi nity dopamine D2 receptors is not suffi cient for drug reward,39,40 and these receptors might even limit drug reward.41 In this respect, drugs emulate the increases in dopamine triggered by phasic dopamine firing, which are the firing frequencies of dopamine neurons associated with rewarding stimuli.42 ",

Balanced circuits result in proper inhibitory control and decision making and normal functioning of reward, motivation, stress, and memory circuits. These circuits also interact with circuits that are involved in mood regulation, including stress reactivity (which involves the amygdala, hypothalamus, and habenula) and interoception (which involves the insula and anterior cingulate cortex and contributes to the awareness of negative emotional states). Drugs of abuse usurp executive function circuits, motivational circuits, and stress circuits via multiple neurotransmitter-specific neuroplasticity circuits (tables 1, 2). Key neurotransmitters that are implicated in these neuroadaptations include dopamine, enkephalins, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), dynorphin, neuropeptide Y, and endocannabinoids (tables 1, 2).

Such cues can be contextual and predictive, and the process of conditioned reinforcement entails not only approach to salient cues but also instrumental responding to turn on the cues, in view of their own rewarding (conditioned reinforcing) properties. As such, conditioned reinforcement as a construct preceded and laid the foundation for incentive salience.55 Incentive salience can be defined as motivation for rewards derived from both one’s physiological state and previously learned associations about a reward cue that is mediated by the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.56 Both conditioned reinforcement and incentive salience provide constructs for what underlies cue-induced drug seeking, self-administration behaviours, and, conceivably, the transition to habit-like compulsive drug seeking.

During acute withdrawal from all drugs of abuse, CRF increases in the extended amygdala (tables 1, 2, circuit 6).

Consistent with this hypothesis, imaging studies have reported differential activation of the insula during craving, possibly reflecting interoceptive cues and hypothesised to involve CRF activation (table 2, circuit 18).54,117,118 Accordingly, the reactivity of this brain region has been suggested to serve as a biomarker to help predict relapse.119 ",

Numerous interventions that tonically activate nucleus accumbens cAMP/PKA signalling promote escalations in drug self-administration or compulsive-like drug-seeking behaviour, and the upregulation of a postsynaptic Gs/cAMP/PKA signalling pathway in the nucleus accumbens might constitute a critical neuroadaptation that is central to the establishment and maintenance of the addicted state.136,137 ",

Introduction of cAMP response element binding protein in the nucleus accumbens decreases the reinforcing value of natural and drug rewards, and this change plausibly contributes to withdrawal/negative affect stage-related decreases in reward pathway function, which leave a drug-abstinent individual in an amotivational, dysphoric, or depressed-like state.138,139 These substance-related changes in susceptibility to negative emotional states might begin early: alcohol use during adolescence might lead to epigenetic modifications that alter amygdalar gene expression and dendritic density, increasing susceptibility to anxiety-like behaviours and alcohol ingestion in adulthood.140 ",

However, a more comprehensive analysis is beyond the scope of this Review. In the binge/intoxication stage, several genes have been identified in animals as key to drug responses, and their modifications strongly affect drug selfadministration.37,153–155 Notably, in animal models, dopamine D1 receptor knockout rats will not self-administer cocaine37 and μ opioid receptor knockout mice will not show the rewarding effects of opioids.153 In humans, only a few specific genes have been identified with polymorphisms (alleles) that either predispose an individual to or protect an individual from drug addiction,156 but the number is growing. For example, genome-wide association studies have implicated two acetylcholine receptors, the α4 nicotinic receptor subunit157 and α5 nicotinic receptor subunit,158 in the vulnerability to nicotine dependence and a singlenucleotide polymorphism associated with regulating the trafficking and gating properties of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (CNIH3) in opioid dependence.159 ",

Identification of these molecular and neurochemical loads on the circuitry provides key information about vulnerability, resilience, treatment, and recovery from addiction, as well as information on how different drugs of abuse enter the overall addiction cycle. Non-drug addictions, such as pathological gambling, have a similar behavioural phenotype that fits into the three-stage cycle. Preliminary imaging data also suggest common neurobiology. Key questions that remain are what genetic factors load these mini circuits, how the environment conveys epigenetic influences on these circuits, and how these circuits recover or do not recover with abstinence and treatment. Resolving these questions should provide biomarkers for prevention, behavioural windows of development for prevention, novel behavioural and pharmaceutical treatments, and ultimately a neurobiological understanding of recovery.

        "text": "Substance use disorders are complex, multistage diseases that are characterised by disturbances in three major neurocircuits: (i) basal gangliadriven binge/intoxication stage, (ii) extended amygdala-driven withdrawal/ negative affect stage, and (iii) prefrontal cortex-driven preoccupation/ anticipation stage. In these three domains, neurotransmitter-specific and neuromodulator-specific neuroplastic changes are seen in 18 subsystems, including the ascending mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, corticotropin-releasing factor in the central nucleus of the amygdala, and corticostriatal glutamate projections. During the binge/intoxication stage, previously neutral stimuli become associated with drug availability, thereby gaining incentive salience and promoting habit formation that fosters excessive drug seeking via increases in dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission. The binge/intoxication stage triggers opponent-process responses that diminish reward function via dopamine and opioid peptide deficits and increased brain stress system activity through the engagement of corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin. Excessive drug intake also drives parallel deficits in executive function via the dysregulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic neuronal networks in the prefrontal cortex, which perpetuate the dysregulation of reward and stress function and induce compulsive drug use. • During the preoccupation/anticipation stage, heightened drug cue-induced incentive salience can act against a background of low reward system function and high stress system function, engaging a powerful combination of positive and negative reinforcement processes that drive pathological drug seeking. Molecular genetic mediation and epigenetic changes in these same circuits provide pre-existing vulnerabilities to addiction, increased susceptibility to environmental risk factors, and targets for development of novel treatments and resilience to relapse.
