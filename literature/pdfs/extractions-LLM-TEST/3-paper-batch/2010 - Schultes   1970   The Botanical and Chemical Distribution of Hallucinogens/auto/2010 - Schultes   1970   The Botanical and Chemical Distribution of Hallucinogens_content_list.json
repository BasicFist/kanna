Then, during the 193Os,several investigators found an active mushroom cult amongst the Mazatecs in Oaxaca and collected, as the hallucinogenic fungi, Panaeolus spbinctrinus and Stropbaria cubensis. Later and more intensive work during the 195Os brought to over 24 species in at least four genera the number of basidiomycetes employed currently in six or more tribes of Mexican Indians (Guzman 1959；Heim 1956,Pp. 965-68,1389-95；1957a;1957b;1963;1966;Heim et al 1967; Schultes 1939;1940; Singer 1958;Wasson 1957; 1958;1959; 1963).
