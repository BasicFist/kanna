        "text": "$( - )$ -Mesembrine is a chiral alkaloid that features an aryloctahydroindole skeleton and is most commonly found in species of the succulent genus Sceletium. Several Sceletium species are used by various ethnic groups in South Africa to manage disorders of the central nervous system. Binding assays have revealed that mesembrine is a more potent inhibitor of the serotonin transporter (SERT) than fluoxetine (Prozac) which has prompted the commercialization of mesembrine-containing consumer products. The congested all carbon quaternary stereocenter present at the bridgehead of mesembrine has rendered it a compound of interest for research in synthetic chemistry, which has assisted in the absolute configuration of the naturally occurring isomer to be assigned. Accordingly, this review will cover the recent literature pertaining to the distribution, structural elucidation, chemotaxonomy, biosynthesis, organic synthesis, as well as the biological activities of $( - )$ -mesembrine. Recent synthetic procedures of the non-natural enantiomer as well as the racemate are also considered. ",

Historically, dried leaves of Sceletium have been used widely by indigenous groups native to southern Africa to elevate the mood and ease anxiety and tension and by shepherds as appetite suppressants during long journeys in dried areas (Gericke and Van Wyk, 1997). Furthermore, extracts prepared from Sceletium have been developed into commercial products for the treatment of central nervous system related disorders including Zembrin®, which is a standardised extract of Sceletium, used by patients for enhancing mood, decreasing anxiety and stress, and improving cognitive function (Dimpfel et al., 2017; Patnala and Kanfer, 2009). The psychoactive properties of Sceletium are attributed to the presence of structurally related alkaloids (Harvey et al., 2011) which can be classified into several skeleton types as shown in Fig. 1 including the mesembrine-type (1), tortuosaminetype (2), the joubertiamine-type (3), channaine (4) and Sceletium alkaloid A4 (5) (Jeffs, 1981; Veale et al., 2018). However, of these, the mesembrine-type scaffold is the most prevalent, which in addition to (1) includes mesembranol (6), mesembrenol (7) and mesembrenone (8) which all share a common cis-3a-aryloctahydroindole nucleus (Krstenansky, 2017).

Furthermore, $( - )$ -mesembrine inhibits serotonin reuptake, and has displayed promise as a mild anti-depressant, anxiolytic, mood elevator and anti-addiction agent (Smith et al., 1996; Stafford et al., 2008). This intriguing biological utility, in addition to its quaternary stereogenic centre has resulted in this compound being intensively pursued through total synthesis (Czekelius, 2018). Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to provide a summary of the isolation, pharmacology and recent stereoselective synthesis of $( - )$ -mesembrine. ",

Bolus [nt], S. rigidum L. Bolus, S. strictum L. Bolus, S. tortuosum (l.) N. E. Br. [nt] and S. varians (Haw.) (Gerbaulet, 1996).

(1998) have indicated their occurrence in other genera of the Mesembryanthemaceae family. Apterna cordifolia, Delosperma pruinosum, and Delosperma pottsii appeared to have some level of $( - )$ -mesembrine. Whereas other species showed negligible or non-detectable level of (−)-mesembrine.

This octahydroindole nucleus derives from a saturated pyrrolidine ring fused to a cyclohexanone, via two bridge-head chiral carbons (C-3a and 7a), whose relative cis arrangement was elucidated from degradation studies and synthesis of the racemate (Popelak et al., 1960; Stevens et al., 1968). This arrangement allows for two likely conformations namely conformation A and B (Fig. 2). A lack of evidence of transdiaxial coupling with the C-7a hydrogen, led to mesembrine being assigned to conformation A, which in conjunction to circular dichroism and $\\mathbf { x }$ -ray crystallography studies of 6-epimesembrenol methiodide led the absolute configuration of $( - )$ - mesembrine being assigned as 3aS, 7aS (Coggon et al., 1970; Jeffs et al., 1969).

This led Jeffs et al. (1974b) to postulate a unified biosynthetic pathway for Sceletium alkaloids, through which sceletenone is a common precursor. As depicted in Fig. 6, the first step resembles that of the biosynthesis of colchicine (Battersby et al., 1972), in which phenylalanine derived $4 ^ { \\prime }$ -hydroxy cinnamic acid (16) and $N$ -functionalised tyramine (17), derived from tyrosine, combine to form a bis-spirodienone (18), which undergoes intramolecular Michael addition to form the sceletenone skeleton, which would then require late stage ring oxidation to form the required-oxygenated ring system of mesembrine (Jeffs et al., 1974b). A series of carefully designed radiolabelled experiments confirmed the intermediacy of cinnamic and 4′hydroxycinnamic acid in 3a-aryl octahydroindole formation (Jeffs et al., 1976) possibly via an aldehyde (Herbert and Kattah, 1989), whilst showing that formation of the octahydroindole skeleton involves a stereospecific protonation at position 7, which would need to occur after Michael addition at C-7 (Jeffs et al., 1976). Finally, it was confirmed that sceletenone is the biosynthetic precursor to the mesembrine class of alkaloids (Jeffs et al., 1978; Jeffs and Karle, 1977). ",

Condensation of 29, with (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)lithium, formed the arylated cyclohexanone (30) which was subsequently reduced in the presence of diisobutylaluminium hydride to generate the key allyl alcohol intermediate (31). The pivotal Johnson-Claisen rearrangement resulted in compound (32) which features the critical quaternary benzylic carbon. Following oxidation with chromium trioxide to form the $\\lvert \\alpha , \\beta$ -unsaturated ketone (33), treatment of the ester with methylamine, resulted in amidation and subsequent intramolecular conjugate addition to form the lactam ring (34). Protection of the cyclohexanone, followed by lactam reduction and acetal hydrolysis resulted in the formation of racemic mesembrine (Scheme 4). ",

The formulation is claimed to be useful in treating mild to moderate depression, stress and anxiety, cancer, inflammation, obesity, hypertension, and obsessivecompulsive disorders.
