The second strongest effects were reduction in both the delta and the theta frequency ranges, correlated with changes in the cholinergic and norepinephrine systems respectively, a pattern seen in preparations prescribed for neurodegenerative diseases.

Linear discriminant analysis confirmed these similarities and demonstrated that all three dosages of Zembrins plotted in close neighbourhood to each other. Citocoline, a synthetic compound originally developed for cognitive enhancement, had a similar electropharmacogram to Zembrins. Similarity to the electropharmacograms of the synthetic phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram, suggests Zembrins has antidepressant and cognitive function enhancing potential. ",

The acute effects of Extract Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrins) administration in 16 healthy young adults was studied in a pharmaco-fMRI study focused on anxiety-related activity in the amygdala and its connected neurocircuitry.

Follow-up connectivity analysis on the emotion matching task demonstrated that amygdala–hypothalamus coupling was also reduced.

With respect to the central nervous system neurotransmitter receptors represent main targets of drugs. Interaction of drugs with these molecules induces a signalling cascade, which finally ends up with the control of ion channel conductance. Since the electric activity of single neurons depends on the set of momentarily active ion channels, communication between neurons is governed by channel activity. From here, it is obvious that field potentials contain the information of larger local networks of electrically active neurons, by it reflecting the interaction of drugs with their targets within the concert of neurotransmission.

Interpretation of the results is made with respect to the likely underlying neurotransmitter activity responsible for changes in the selected frequency ranges, and aims at advancing an understanding of possible clinical applications in humans. The relationship between EEG delta waves and cholinergic neurotransmission was first recognised in 2005 (Dimpfel, 2005), while it was recognized that theta waves are influenced by drugs acting at the biochemically defined norepinephrine alpha2 receptor (Dimpfel and Schober, 2001). Presynaptic interaction with this receptor leads to drowsiness and sleep, and increases of theta waves have been used as part of a formula describing depth of sleep in humans. Dopaminergic activity is reflected by changes in alpha2 frequencies (Dimpfel, 2008). ",

Based on numerous experimental results it has been concluded that preparations inducing a similar pattern of changes of spectral power have similar clinical therapeutic indications (Dimpfel, 2003). Zembrins dose dependently induced attenuation of all frequency ranges to a varying degree. The most prominent was the statistically significant reduction in alpha2 and beta1a waves, correlated with activation of the dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmitter systems respectively. This feature is common to all synthetic and herbal stimulants tested to date. The second strongest effects were reduction in both the delta and the theta frequency ranges, correlated with changes in the cholinergic and norepinephrine systems respectively, a pattern seen in preparations prescribed for neurodegenerative diseases. Theta wave reduction in common with the delta, alpha2 and beta1 attenuation has been noted for analgesic drugs. Attenuation of alpha1 waves emerged during the highest dosage in all brain areas, a feature seen in all antidepressants. The dose dependent increase of gamma activity has been clearly related to motion in a previous publication (Dimpfel and Schombert, 2015), however no conclusions could be made as direct measurement of motion resulted in too high variability, while gamma activity had already appeared simply with the first motion of the head.

With respect to botanicals or herbal preparations a special extract of Oenothera biennis containing $5 0 \\%$ polyphenols was recognized as the most similar herbal preparation to the middle dosage of Zembrins. Extracts of Cimicifuga racemosa and Ginkgo biloba showed a quite similar profile of changes to those for Zembrin. The electropharmacogram for Ginkgo biloba extract was similar to that for Zembrins, with the difference consisting of attenuation of alpha1 spectral power in Ginkgo, an effect not apparent in the profile for Zembrins at lower doses. A close similarity to the action of Zembrins was also observed for an extract of Rhodiola rosea. Rhodiola has been classified as a so-called adaptogenic botanical, which helps one cope with physical and emotional stress. The clinical efficacy of a Rhodiola rosea extract has been recently characterized using a combination of fast dynamic EEG analysis (Neurocode-Tracking) in combination with Eye-Tracking (now called “Enkephalovision”) (Dimpfel, 2014).
