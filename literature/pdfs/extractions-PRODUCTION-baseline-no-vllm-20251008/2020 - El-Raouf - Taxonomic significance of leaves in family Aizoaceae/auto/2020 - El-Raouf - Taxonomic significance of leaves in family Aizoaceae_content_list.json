        "text": "Aizoaceae is one of the most important and widespread succulent plant families in both tropical/subtropical regions and arid zones. In this study, 27 species were collected from various floristic regions in Egypt, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and cactus farms (Kalupia – Egypt). The morphological characteristics of every taxon were recorded. The important morphological features included: the number of leaves per plant; leaf types; leaf position (cauline or radical; the latter indicates leaves arising from, or near, the roots); leaf arrangement; petiolate or sessile leaves; leaf sheath present or absent; leaf shape; leaf margin; leaf tip; presence of leaf ‘window area’; leaf texture; and presence of white or dark miniscule dots (white miniscule dots from calcium carbonate and dark miniscule dots from tannin sacs). The investigated anatomical features were as follows: shape of the transverse section; the type of epidermal cells; the presence of large epidermal cells (bladder cells); presence of papilla and simple hairs; presence of tannin sacs; shapes of calcium oxalate crystals; shape of the xylem vessels; and the presence of Kranz unit (the unit that constitutes the vascular bundle/s, parenchyma sheath, and surrounding mesophyll) or collenchyma sheath. All data were recorded in a data matrix (as either text or numerical data), which was used to construct the identification key and phylogeny tree using a multi-variate statistical package. The results of our analysis may open the possibility of using the morphological and anatomical features of leaves to distinguish between the subfamilies, genera, and species of Aizoaceae. ",

        "text": "Aizoaceae Rudolphi is a family of flowering plants that comprises 143 genera and approximately 2300 species across the tropical and subtropical regions, primarily in the coastal or arid habitats. This family belongs to Centrospermae (Order: Caryophyllales) (Eckardt, 1976; Ehrendorfer, 1976). Aizoaceae sensu lato includes five groups: Aizoon group, Mesembryanthemum group, Tetragonia group, Sesuvium group, and Mollogo group (De Jussieu, 1789; De Candolle, 1828; Solereder, 1899; Müller, 1909; Bessey, 1915; Engler, 1924; Rendle, 1925; Lawrence, 1963; Thorne, 1968). Aizoaceae sensu stricto includes four of these groups, except for the Mollugo group (Horaninow, 1834; ",

        "text": "Schwantes, 1960; Hutchinson, 1973; Takhtajan, 1980; Cronquist, 1981; Dahlgren, 1983; Hartmann, 2001). Aizoaceae sensu stricto can be divided into five subfamilies, Mesembryanthemoideae, Tetragonioideae, Sesuvioideae, Aizooideae, and Ruschioideae, which include $8 5 \\%$ of their genera. Separation of the Mollugo group from the rest was previously investigated and recently supported by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG, 1998). The family Aizoaceae has synonymous names based on the regional occurrence of the genera and the delimitation of the groups or subfamilies (Bentham and Hooker, 1867; Sprengel, 1818; Wilson, 1932; Harvey and Sonder, 1826; Pax, 1889; Mabry, 1977). Most taxonomists have divided Aizoaceae depending on their reproductive organ characteristics (e.g., stamens and petals with stamineal origin, united or free; leafy bracts of inflorescences or not; nectar gland shape; placentation, and ovary position) (Bittrich and Hartmann, 1988). Morphological characteristics are features of external form or appearance, which are currently most used for practical plant identification, whereas some morphological characteristics are used for hypothesizing phylogenetic relationships. Morphological characteristics are easily observed and used in taxonomic keys and descriptions. Anatomical plant characteristics have been used for taxonomic purposes for over 150 years, and they are useful in both the practical identification and determination of phylogenetic relationships (Judd et al., 2016). The leaves of Aizoaceae species are opposite, rarely alternate, simple, free, or completely united into a single conical or spherical body, often sheathing to its stem. The leaves of individual species may be similar or different (homophyllous or heterophyllous). Some species show a peculiar vegetative form when their leaves reduce to a single annual pair of leaves, or they may be partly subterranean with only one clear window at each leaf tip exposed above the ground (Watson and Dallwitz, 1992) see Plate 1.

        "text": "The anatomical features of Aizoaceae leaves were observed by Metcalfe and Chalk (1957), who described the types of their epidermis, stomata, hairs, mesophyll, and the shape of their crystals. In addition, Aizoaceae leaves were found to be characterized by thickenings and modified for water storage (Bhambie et al., 1977; Dioni, 2004). In some Aizoaceae species that exhibit the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), mesophyll cells are not usually differentiated into palisade and spongy parenchyma (Kluge and Ting, 1978); there tends to be less free air space between the mesophyll cells of C3 and C4 plants than between the mesophyll cells of CAM plants (Luttge and Ball, 1977). Aizoaceae members include numerous ornamental species, such as Lampranthus, Dorotheanthus, Mesembryanthemum, Ruscia, and Carpobrotus. Some members, such as Tetragonia, are used as vegetables. This study aimed to use the morphological and anatomical characteristics of leaves as taxonomical evidence to clear describe the leaf characteristics of Aizoaceae species to attempt to divide the subfamilies and discrimination between genera and species depending on morphological and anatomical features of leaves.

The genus Lithops differed from the others by species with one pair of leaves (Fig. 2). Moreover, a few taxa showed heterophyllous characteristics, e.g., Trianthema portulacastrum (Fig. 3). Most taxa, e.g., Trianthema portulacastrum, had cauline leaves (Fig. 3); however, a few taxa had radical leaves (leaves arising from, or near, the root), e.g., Lithops (Fig. 2). Regarding leaf arrangement, there were two forms: opposite in many taxa, such as Aptenia cordifolia (Fig. 4), or alternate in some taxa, e.g., Aizoon canariense (Fig. 5). In most examined taxa, the leaves were sessile e.g., Faucaria bosscheana, (Fig. 6), whereas a few taxa, e.g., Zaleya pentandra, had petiolate leaves (Fig. 1). The leaf base was connate in some taxa, e.g., Carpobrotus acinaciformis (Fig. 7), and it was not connate in others, such as Zaleya pentandra (Fig. 1). Two taxa, Aizoon canariense and Trianthema portulacastrum, had distinguished leaf sheaths (Fig. 3). Leaf shape showed wide differences among species, and 12 shapes were recorded: (1) clavate, e.g., Fenestraria rhopalophylla (Fig. 8); (2) conical, e.g., genus Lithops (Fig. 2); (3) cordate, e.g., Aptenia cordifolia (Fig. 4); (4) elliptic, e.g., Zaleya pentandra (Fig. 1); (5) keel, e.g., Faucaria tuberculosa (Fig. 9); (6) linear, e.g., Glottiphyllum linguiforme (Fig. 10); (7) obovate, e.g., Trianthema portulacastrum (Fig. 3); (8) ovate, e.g., Delosperma echinatum (Fig. 11); (9) semi globose, e.g., Pleiospilos nellii (Table 2); (10) spathulate, e.g., Aloinopsis malherbei (Fig. 12); (11) terete, e.g., Drosanthemum floribundum (Fig. 13); and (12) triangular, e.g., Carpobrotus acinaciformis (Fig. 7). Three types of leaf margins were recorded: entire in most taxa, e.g., Aptenia cordifolia (Fig. 4), dentate in several taxa, e.g., Oscularia deltoids (Fig. 14), and spiny (prickles) in two Faucaria species, (Fig. 6 and 9). The leaf tip was acute in many taxa, such as Aizoon canariense (Fig. 5), and obtuse or truncate in others, such as Trianthema portulacastrum (Fig. 3) and Lithops (Fig. 2), respectively. Some Aizoaceae members were distinguished from others by ‘window areas’, which contained transparent parenchyma cells that allowed light to pass into the chlorenchyma cells. ",

The recorded epidermis types were: normal type (isodiametric epidermal cells, polygonal, outer wall at most slightly sinuous), which was observed in most of the examined taxa, e.g., Sesuvium portulacastrum (Fig. 18); conophytum type (epidermal cells externally covered by a very thick, flat, continuous layer of cuticle extending over the entire surface except the stomata), which was recorded in few taxa, e.g., Aloinopsis malherbei (Fig. 19); lithops type (epidermal cells externally protected by a thick layer of cuticle-forming, rounded, blunt papillae over individual epidermal cells), which was only observed in Lithops species (Fig. 20); and the last type of epidermis in which a proportion of epidermal cells was united in groups that were collectively much larger than the remaining epidermal cells (this type was only noticed in Aptenia cordifolia) (Fig. 21). Large epidermal cells (bladder cells) included water storage cells, such as Aptenia cordifolia (Fig. 22). Most examined taxa had a simple epidermis, except for two taxa that had a multiplicative epidermis, Zaleya pentandra and Trianthema portulacastrum (Fig. 23). Rare taxa with large mesophylls e.g., Lithops pseudotruncatella, were distinguished from others by the presence of internal epidermal cells in short layers (Fig. 24). Two forms of trichomes were noticed: papillae, e.g., in Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum (Fig. 25), and simple hairs, e.g., in Delosperma echinatum (Table 3). ",

He also indicated that Zaleya pentandra leaves may be elliptic or oblanceolate with obtuse to rounded tips. Moreover, Groen and Van der (1999), described the leaves belonging to the genus Faucaria as succulent leaves with flat upper sides, smooth or rough lower parts, keeled leaves, bristle-tipped teeth, and whitish dots. These observations are in accordance with those of Hartmann (2001), who reported that some Aizoaceae plants with a single pair of leaves were sometimes sunken into the ground. The results of the present study were also in accordance with those of Clak et al. (2015), who reported that the leaves of Cheiridopsis albaoculata were succulent and trigonous, with ‘window areas’ and connate sheath, keel shape, and dentate margins. Judd et al.
