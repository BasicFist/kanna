        "text": "Abstract  The PDE4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases are essential regulators of cAMP abundance in the CNS through their ability to regulate PKA activity, the phosphorylation of CREB, and other important elements of signal transduction. In pre-clinical models and in early-stage clinical trials, PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to have antidepressant and memory-enhancing activity. However, the development of clinically-useful PDE4 inhibitors for CNS disorders has been limited by variable efficacy and significant side effects. Recent structural studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular configuration of PDE4 enzymes, especially the “long” PDE4 isoforms that are abundant in the CNS. The new structural data provide a rationale for the development of a new generation of PDE4 inhibitors that specifically act on long PDE4 isoforms. These next generation PDE4 inhibitors may also be capable of targeting the interactions of select long forms with their “partner” proteins, such as RACK1, $\\beta$ -arrestin, and DISC1. They would therefore have the ability to affect cAMP levels in specific cellular compartments and target localized cellular functions, such as synaptic plasticity. These new agents might also be able to target PDE4 populations in select regions of the CNS that are implicated in learning and memory, affect, and cognition. Potential therapeutic uses of these agents could include affective disorders, memory enhancement, and neurogenesis. ",

        "text": "The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDE4) enzymes) hydrolyze the ubiquitous “second messenger” cAMP and thereby serve to regulate its abundance in specific sub-cellular compartments (Francis et  al. 2011; Conti and Beavo 2007; Houslay 2010; Maurice et al. 2014; Baillie 2009; Menniti et al. 2006). They are an essential component of the cAMP signal transduction system, which also includes adenylyl cyclase, specific G-proteins, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the cAMPdependent protein kinase (PKA) and the cAMP target, Epac (Beavo and Brunton 2002). The PDE4 family is a member of the cyclic nucleotide PDE super-family, which consists of 11 distinct families (PDE1 through PDE11, respectively) that can be distinguished by their substrate specificity (cGMP and/or cAMP), molecular structure, and their ability to be inhibited by family-selective inhibitors (Bolger 2007). Like all members of the PDE super-family, the PDE4s are important targets for drug discovery. Currently, three PDE4-selective inhibitors, roflumilast, apremilast and crisaborole, have been developed for clinical use, in COPD and inflammatory disorders (Fabbri et al. 2009; Calverley et al. 2009; Hatzelmann et al. 2010; Page and Spina 2012; Schafer et al. 2014; Kavanaugh et al. 2015; Papp et al. 2015; Murrell et al. 2015), and additional PDE4 inhibitors are being tested in a wide variety of pre-clinical models and in clinical trials (Page and Spina 2012; Zhang et al. 2005a; Bruno et al. 2011; Giembycz and Maurice 2014; Richter et al. 2013). PDE4s are expressed in many areas of the CNS and PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to have antidepressant, anti-psychotic, and memory-enhancing actions in both rodent models and in humans (Fleischhacker et  al. 1992; Scott et  al. 1991; Hebenstreit et al. 1989; Eckmann et al. 1988; Zeller et al. 1984; Bobon et al. 1988; Barad et al. 1998; Bach et al. 1999; Titus et al. 2013; Mueller et al. 2010; Nibuya et al. 1996; O’Donnell and Zhang 2004; Kanes et al. 2007; Halene and Siegel 2008). However, the development of clinically-effective PDE4 inhibitors in CNS disorders has been hampered by lack of effectiveness and significant side effects, such as nausea (Higgs 2010; Gavalda and Roberts 2013).

The PDE4s are encoded by four different genes in mammals (called PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C and $P D E 4 D$ in humans), with additional diversity being produced by alternative mRNA splicing and the use of several isoform-specific promoters within each gene (Conti and Beavo 2007; Houslay 2010; Maurice et  al. 2014; Bolger 2007; Bolger et al. 1993; Swinnen et al. 1989). Each of the PDE4 isoforms has a distinct pattern of expression in cells and tissues and the vast majority of them has been demonstrated to have an isoform-specific pattern of expression in the CNS (Bolger et al. 1994; Cherry and Davis 1999; Miro et al. 2002; D’Sa et al. 2005; D’Sa et al. 2002; Reyes-Irisarri et al. 2008; Nishi et al. 2008; Mori et al. 2010; Kuroiwa et  al. 2012; Ahmed and Frey 2003).

In addition, each isoform has a unique aminoterminal region, encoded by one or more exons specific to that isoform, that frequently has unique properties. For example, the unique amino-terminus of the widely-found PDE4D5 isoform (Fig.  4.1) is essential for its interaction with its “partner” proteins (Bolger et al. 1997; Perry et al. 2002; Bolger et al. 2003; Baillie et al. 2003; Shukla et al. 2014; Yarwood et al. 1999; Bolger et al. 2002; Steele et al. 2001; Li et  al. 2009a; Bolger et  al. 2006; Baillie et  al. 2007; Smith et  al. 2007). PDE4D5 interacts selectively with $\\beta$ -arrestin2, implicated in the regulation of GPCRs and other cell signaling components (Perry et al. 2002; Bolger et al. 2003; Baillie et al. 2003; Li et al. 2009a; Bolger et al. 2006; Baillie et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2007; Bradaia et al. 2005; Lynch et al. 2005), and also with the $\\beta$ -propeller protein RACK1 (Yarwood et al. 1999; Bolger et al. 2002; Steele et al. 2001; Bolger et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2007; Bird et al. 2010). In contrast, the PDE4B1 isoform, which has an amino-terminal region completely different from that of PDE4D5, interacts selectively with the DISC1 protein, implicated in affective disorders and schizophrenia (Millar et al. 2005; Murdoch et al. 2007; Bradshaw et al. 2011; HayashiTakagi et al. 2010).

For example, five different isoforms encoded by the PDE4D gene have differ less than fivefold in their $K _ { m }$ for cAMP and in their $I C _ { 5 0 }$ for the prototypical PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram (Bolger et al. 1997). The catalytic regions of the proteins encoded by the four different PDE4 genes are extremely similar (approximately $90 \\%$ sequence identity). As all PDE4-selective inhibitors act, at least in part, at the catalytic sites of the PDE4 enzymes (Lee et  al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2004a; Card et al. 2004; Huai et al. 2004; Burgin et al. 2010; Wang et al. $2 0 0 7 \\mathrm { a }$ ; Kranz et al. 2009; Fox et al. 2014; Gurney et al. 2011), and therefore act, at least in part, as competitive inhibitors of cAMP hydrolysis, the similarity among the catalytic sites of the isoforms has greatly complicated the development of inhibitors selective for any individual isoform, or even for all the isoforms encoded by one PDE4 gene. Although some newer compounds may be more selective (Bruno et al. 2011), most PDE4-selective inhibitors have less than a tenfold difference in potency (i.e., $I C _ { 5 0 , }$ ) for isoforms encoded by different PDE4 genes (Hatzelmann et al. 2010; Burgin et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2007a).

Recently, the dimerization of long PDE4 isoforms has been greatly illuminated by structural and enzymatic studies (Cedervall et al. 2015). The structural data built on prior interaction studies, including yeast 2-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation, and extensive mutagenesis studies, that suggested an interaction between specific regions of UCR1 and UCR2, which appeared to form a module that in turn interacted with the catalytic domain (Bolger et  al. 1993; Richter and Conti 2002; Richter and Conti 2004; Xie et  al. 2014; Bolger et al. 2015; Lim et al. 1999; Beard et al. 2000). They have also demonstrated conclusively, consistent with previous data (Richter and Conti 2002; Richter and Conti 2004; Xie et al. 2014; Bolger et al. 2015), that long PDE4 isoforms can form dimers, with UCR1 and UCR2 being essential components of the dimeric structure (Cedervall et al. 2015). Collectively, these approaches have shown that dimerization is mediated by an interaction of $\\alpha$ -helical regions in the C-terminus of UCR1 with the N-terminus of UCR2, forming a tight 4-helix bundle (Richter and Conti 2002; Cedervall et al. 2015; Beard et al. 2000). Also present in the dimer is an interaction between UCR2 of one member of the dimer and the catalytic region of the other, providing a mechanism by which UCR2 serves as an auto-inhibitory domain (Cedervall et al. 2015). Finally, there is a smaller, but nonetheless biochemically significant, interface between the two catalytic domains, mediated by electrostatic interactions between Asp463 and Arg499 (PDE4D5 co-ordinates; Asp 471 and Arg507 in PDE4B1; refs.

        "text": "Dimerization provides many new insights into the enzymology and pharmacology of long PDE4 isoforms. The enzymatic and pharmacologic characteristics of the dimeric form are markedly different from those of the corresponding monomer. The dimeric form appears to exist as a “closed” or less-active conformation of the enzyme, with a specific activity for cAMP hydrolysis of dimeric PDE4B1 being roughly 50-fold lower than the corresponding monomeric form (Cedervall et  al. 2015). Dimerization also affects the ability of long PDE4 isoforms to be inhibited by many PDE4-selective inhibitors; the effect of dimerization has been best-studied with the prototypical PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (Cedervall et al. 2015). These differences are mediated by a specific $\\alpha$ -helical domain in the C-terminal half of UCR2 that, in the dimer, associates in trans with the catalytic domain (Cedervall et  al. 2015), to create a high-affinity rolipram binding site (HARBS). In contrast, in the monomer, inhibitor binding is mediated exclusively by the catalytic region, to form a low-affinity rolipram-binding site (LARBS). The presence of a HARBS therefore reflects a conformational state unique to long PDE4 isoforms; short PDE4 isoforms, which lack UCR1 and therefore cannot dimerize, do not have a HARBS (Richter and Conti 2004; Huston et  al. 1996; Rocque et  al. 1997a; Rocque et  al. 1997b; Souness and Rao 1997). These insights expand and modify prior models of PDE4 active site conformation (Lee et  al. 2002; Zhang et  al. 2004a; Card et  al. 2004; Burgin et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2007a; Kranz et al. 2009; Fox et al. 2014; Gurney et al. 2011; Huai et al. 2006) and are highly likely to stimulate the identification of inhibitors that interact primarily with UCR2, with relatively less interaction with the catalytic domain (Fig. 4.2). These “long-isoform interactive” PDE4 inhibitors might therefore have a safety and/or efficacy profile distinct from the current generation of PDE4 inhibitors (Cedervall et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2003a).

Roflumilast clearly acts similarly (i.e., with an $I C _ { 5 0 }$ less than fivefold different) on the long and short forms encoded by any individual PDE4 gene (Hatzelmann et al. 2010). Similarly, the data on apremilast suggests that, like cilomilast (Giembycz 2001), it acts roughly equally on both long and short forms (Schafer et al. 2014). Another important characteristic of both roflumilast and apremilast is that their penetration into the CNS may be limited by the blood-brain barrier. There is little published pre-clinical data on crisaborole, which is designed for topical application. These characteristics of the currently-approved PDE4 inhibitors probably account for their improved tolerability in inflammatory and pulmonary disorders, compared to older agents, such as rolipram. However, it is clear that these clinically-useful characteristics of these three drugs actually reduces their potency in the CNS, indicating that further compound development work is essential to optimize the CNS-selectivity and effectiveness of PDE4-selective inhibitors. I present a potential pathway for these developmental activities below. ",

Specifically, blocking phosphorylation at both the PKA and ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites diminished dimerization; mutations of each individual site had only modest effect (Bolger 2016). The precise mechanism of how PKA-ERK1/2 phosphorylation might promote dimerization is uncertain; however, it is likely that phosphorylation at these sites would affect the conformation of the dimer and thereby push the equilibrium towards the dimeric form. In contrast, our analysis of phospho-mimetic mutations at the MK2 and stress oxidation kinase sites suggests that their action would be to promote the monomeric form. ",

Recently, we demonstrated that the dimerization of PDE4D5 was blocked by two well-characterized protein partners, specifically RACK1 and $\\beta$ -arrestin2 (Bolger 2016). Given the high avidity and multiple sites of interaction between PDE4D5 and both of these proteins (Perry et al. 2002; Bolger et al. 2003; Baillie et al. 2003; Yarwood et al. 1999; Bolger et al. 2002; Steele et al. 2001; Li et al. $2 0 0 9 \\mathrm { a }$ ; Bolger et al. 2006; Baillie et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2007), it is perhaps not surprising that they would have such an effect. However, since our prior studies have shown that both RACK1 and $\\beta$ -arrestin2 largely interact with the unique N-terminal and C-terminal regions of PDE4D5 (Bolger et al. 2003; Yarwood et al. 1999; Bolger et al. 2002; Bolger et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2007), which are unstructured in the dimer (Cedervall et al. 2015), it is unlikely that they act to directly restrict interaction at the UCR1/UCR2/catalytic or catalytic/catalytic interfaces that mediate dimerization. Instead, they presumably have indirect effects, possibly by sequestering the monomeric protein and thereby preventing it from forming a dimer, or by affecting its conformation in other ways. Inhibiting the dimerization of PDE4D5 could have multiple possible functional roles, such as increasing the enzymatic activity of PDE4D5 in certain cellular contexts, or targeting monomeric PDE4D5 to specific subcellular compartments.

RACK1 interacts avidly with the “closed” conformation of PDE4D5, which is not entirely surprising, given its high avidity and selectivity for PDE4D5 and the extensive regions on PDE4D5 that can interact with RACK1 (Bolger 2016). However, in contrast, $\\beta$ -arrestin2 did not detectably interact with the “closed” conformation (Bolger 2016). This observation could provide novel insight into the physiological mechanism of the PDE4D5- $\\beta$ -arrestin2 interaction, in which $\\beta$ -arrestin2 serves to recruit PDE4D5 to the ligand-occupied, GRK2- phosphorylated state of the $\\beta _ { 2 }$ -adrenergic receptor and thereby down-regulate cAMP signaling (Perry et  al. 2002; Baillie et  al. 2003). Since the major function of this recruitment is to move PDE4 enzymatic activity close to the $\\beta _ { 2 }$ -adrenergic receptor, it would be logical that $\\beta$ -arrestin2 preferentially recruit the monomeric, or “open,” form of PDE4D5, as this has much higher catalytic activity (50-fold greater, as measured for PDE4B1; Cedervall et al. 2015). Therefore, the preferential interaction of $\\beta$ -arrestin2 with the monomeric form would maximize its physiologic function. ",

Since both of these processes require intimate contact between a PDE4 protein and its “partner” or kinase, these studies have also provided support for the concept that PDE4 regulation is highly spatially-dependent in cells, thereby providing a mechanism for the regulation of cAMP abundance in specific sub-cellular compartments (Francis et al. 2011; Conti and Beavo 2007; Houslay 2010; Bolger et al. 2007). This concept is particularly attractive in neurons, where PDE4 action could be targeted to specific synapses, axons, or dendrites, or other sub-cellular structures, rather than modulating cAMP levels globally throughout the cell. This compartmentalization of cAMP signaling, and PDE4 action in particular, is in turn compatible with PKA having different substrates in specific cellular compartments that are in turn regulated by different PDE4 isoforms. Selective targeting of these PDE4 isoforms could therefore produce highly specific pharmacologic effects, as discussed in the next section. ",

It is a $3 2 \\mathrm { k D a }$ protein that is phosphorylated at T34 by several kinases, including PKA, and at T75 by Cdk5. Phosphorylation of DARPP32 at T34 in turn depends on the phosphorylation state of S102 and S137, which are phosphorylated by CK2 and CK1, respectively (Svenningsson et  al. 2004). Activation of the D1 dopamine receptor, a GPCR, by dopamine activates adenylyl cyclase and thereby PKA, increasing pT34-DARPP32 (Svenningsson et al. 2004; Stipanovich et al. 2008). Dopamine antagonists, such as haloperidol, and many drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, exert many of their effects through T34- DARPP32 phosphorylation (Bateup et  al. 2008; Volkow and Morales 2015). As pT34-DARPP32 is in turn a potent inhibitor of PPT1 and pT75-DARPP32 is a potent inhibitor of PKA (Svenningsson et al. 2004), phosphorylation of DARPP32 produces profound changes in many cellular signaling pathways (Nishi et al. 2008; Svenningsson et al. 2004). pT34-DARPP32 can translocate to the nucleus, where it can inhibit nuclear PPT-1, enhance phosphorylation of histone H3, and regulate transcription (Stipanovich et al. 2008). Rolipram has been shown to enhance pT34- DARPP32 phosphorylation in striatopallidal neurons; this effect is accompanied by significant PKA-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), essential for dopamine synthesis and turnover (Nishi et al. 2008). In contrast, PDE10 inhibition has no effect on TH phosphorylation, but substantially increases pT34- DARPP32 phosphorylation in striatal neurons (Nishi et al. 2008). The differential effects of these PDE4 inhibitors on dopamine signaling support investigation of PDE4-selective inhibitors as therapy in psychiatric and drug abuse disorders mediated, at least in part, by dopamine neurotransmission.

Some isoforms, such as PDE4D5, are broadly-expressed in multiple CNS and non-CNS tissues (Miro et al. 2002; Bolger et al. 1997), while others, such as PDE4A1, are expressed strongly in a few tissues (e.g., cerebellum for PDE4A1) and expressed at much lower levels elsewhere (Shakur et al. 1995). These pronounced differences in regional expression in the CNS suggest strongly that each isoform has a distinct function; however, in most cases, the precise neurobiological function(s) of each isoform have only begun to be appreciated. Better knowledge of the regional expression of PDE4 isoforms would in turn provide improved understanding of the phenotypes of genetically-altered PDE4 mice, as described in detail in a subsequent section.

Experimental studies of addiction in a variety of model systems have identified many of the neuronal circuit, behavioral, and synaptic mechanisms involving this process (Volkow and Morales 2015). These studies have identified and characterized a drug-reward neuronal pathway in the CNS, extending from dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Many drugs of abuse, including opioids and cocaine, increase dopamine release in the shell subregion of the NAc (Di 2002) and elsewhere. Dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors increase cAMP levels and the phosphorylation of CREB (Bibb 2005; Dudman et  al. 2003; Antoine et  al. 2013). Rolipram administration given prior to drug administration substantially reduced morphine-, cocaine- and cannabinoid-induced conditioned place preference in mice (Thompson et al. 2004; Zhong et al. 2012; Janes et al. 2009). Additionally, rolipram and other PDE4-selective inhibitors blocked inhibitory LTD and acute depression of inhibitory postsynaptic currents induced by D2 receptor and cannabinoid receptor agonists in VTA dopamine neurons (Zhong et al. 2012).

PDE4B and PDE4D isoforms are present in the NAc shell and that their expression is increased upon chronic administration of antidepressants (Cherry and Davis 1999; Takahashi et al. 1999). These effects are likely to be mediated by CREB, as over-expression of dominant-negative CREB in the NAc had an antidepressant effect in the learned-helpless model, while over-expression of wild-type CREB had an opposite effect (Newton et  al. 2002). The specificity of these studies to depression is not clear, especially as chronic treatment with a number of antidepressants having different mechanisms of action (including tricyclics, SSRIs and PDE4 inhibitors) all increase levels of various PDE4 isoforms in a number of different areas of the brain (D’Sa et al. 2005; D’Sa et al. 2002; Ye et al. 1997; Ye et  al. 2000; Zhao et  al. 2003b; Dlaboga et  al. 2006).

(Havekes et al. 2015; Meerlo et al. 2015) for a review. Normally, sleep promotes the development of dendritic spines after learning, implicating a beneficial role of sleep in memory consolidation (Yang et al. 2014). In contrast, sleep deprivation has been shown to produce memory loss in a number of rodent models of learning and memory, which is associated with impairment of cAMP- and PKA-dependent forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Vecsey et al. 2009). Sleep deprivation increases PDE4 activity, possibly as a compensatory process (Vecsey et al. 2009). Transiently elevating cAMP levels in hippocampal excitatory neurons during sleep deprivation prevents memory consolidation deficits associated with sleep loss. These observations provide further evidence for the benefit of PDE4 inhibition on cognition and memory. The specificity of the benefit of PDE4 inhibition to sleep-disordered memory loss is uncertain, however, as rolipram and other PDE4 inhibitors improve cognitive function generally in mice, as described in greater detail in the next section.

Its activity as a highly-selective PDE4 inhibitor was determined only after the publication of these early behavioral studies (Nemoz et  al. 1985). Extensive testing of rolipram and numerous other PDE4- selective inhibitors in behavioral assays in rodents has demonstrated that they have activity that is broadly similar to other antidepressant agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs and SNRIs. Specifically, PDE4-selective inhibitors have antidepressant-­like activity in hypothermia assays and in the forced-swim and tailsuspension tests (Barad et al. 1998; Bach et al. 1999; Titus et al. 2013; Mueller et al. 2010; Nibuya et al. 1996; O’Donnell and Zhang 2004; Zhang et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2011; Jindal et  al. 2012) and other assays (Wachtel 1983; O’Donnell 1993; O’Donnell and Frith 1999; Wachtel and Schneider 1986) used in the pre-clinical testing of antidepressants. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that most classes of antidepressant drugs, although having disparate immediate targets, ultimately have overlapping effects on cAMP signaling pathways (Zhang et al. 2005b). For example, in rodents, several different classes of antidepressants elevate PDE4 levels, especially levels of PDE4D (Takahashi et al. 1999; Ye et al. 1997; Ye et al. 2000; Zhao et al. 2003b; Dlaboga et al. 2006) and increases levels of CREB (Nibuya et al. 1996) and phospho-CREB (Li et al. 2009b).

The potential memory-­enhancing effects of PDE inhibition have been investigated for decades (Villiger and Dunn 1981) and the effects of rolipram studied soon after it was first synthesized (Randt et al. 1982) and subsequently (Egawa et al. 1997; Imanishi et al. 1997). The potential value of PDE4 inhibition in disorders of cognition and memory received support from two studies from the Kandel laboratory in 1999 that suggested that PDE4-selective inhibitors have cognitive- and memory-enhancing activity in mice (Barad et al. 1998; Bach et al. 1999). These results have been confirmed by other groups, using a range of experimental conditions (Zhang et al. 2005a; Titus et al. 2013; Mueller et al. 2010; Kuroiwa et al. 2012; Ahmed and Frey 2003; Xiao et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2004b; Hajjhussein et al. 2007; Rutten et al. 2009; Rutten et al. 2007a; Rutten et al. 2007b; Cheng et al. 2010; Li et al. 2011a; Rutten et al. 2008a; Rutten et al. 2006; Navakkode et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013; Guan et al. 2011; Werenicz et al. 2012; Hotte et al. 2012; Giralt et al. 2011; Li et al. 2011b). One distinct experimental approach has been the use of NMDA inhibitors as pre-treatment prior to PDE4 inhibition; PDE4 inhibition clearly can reverse, at least in part, memory loss produced by these inhibitors (Zhang et al. 2005a; Zhang et al. 2000; Hajjhussein et al. 2007; Suvarna and O’Donnell 2002; Kato et al. 1997; Wiescholleck and Manahan-Vaughan 2012).

The effects of rolipram and other PDE4-selective inhibitors on cognition, learning and memory appear to be distinct from their antidepressant effects, as antidepressants of other classes do not seem to have these effects (Makhay et al. 2001). The results of all these studies have stimulated the development of PDE4 inhibitors specifically targeted at cognition and memory enhancement (Zhang et al. 2005a; Zhang et al. 2006); however, clinical trials of these compounds to date have proved to be disappointing.

These side effects of PDE4-selective inhibitors appear to be related to their pharmacologic mechanism of action, in that gastric acid production and secretory diarrhea are both caused by elevation of cAMP levels in GI epithelium (Hatzelmann et  al. 2010; Lambert et al. 2014; Barnette et al. 1995; Okuda et al. 2009). Studies of both the CNS and non-CNS side effects of PDE4 inhibitors have been complicated by the lack of selectivity of PDE4 inhibitors for any individual PDE4 isoform, or subset of PDE4 isoforms, thereby rendering it uncertain which PDE4 isoform(s) are responsible for any specific side effect.

As a precedent for this approach, we and our collaborators have used dominant-­negative PDE4 mutants successfully in cell-based studies (Perry et  al. 2002; Baillie et  al. 2003; Bolger et  al. 2006). In these cell-based studies, the dominant-­negative mutant protein has been shown to displace the corresponding endogenous PDE4 isoform from its protein partner(s) and therefore disrupt its cellular function(s). The use of a dominant-negative mutant has the potential to be more isoform-selective than a gene knockout: The murine Pde4b and human PDE4B gene both encode five isoforms (Bolger et al. 1993; Bolger et al. 1994; Swinnen et al. 1991; Huston et al. 1997; Shepherd et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2010), each with a distinct protein structure and pattern of expression in tissues. Therefore, the $P d e 4 b { - } 1 { - }$ mice described above have a phenotype that reflects the combined deficiency of all five PDE4B isoforms, which greatly complicates analysis of the effect(s) of any individual isoform, such as PDE4B1. The generation of dominant-negative mutants as transgenes also follows a strategy used by other groups who have expressed a dominant-negative PKA RIα subunit (Abel et  al. 1997), or a dominant-negative CREB mutant (Silva et al. 1998; Kida et al. 2002; Ahn et al. 1999; Pittenger et al. 2002; Barco et al. 2002; Pittenger et al. 2006; Lonze et al. 2002; Vecsey et al. 2009) in the CNS. In the vast majority of these studies, the dominant-negative transgene was expressed off the CaMKIIα promoter (Mayford et al. 1996a; Mayford et al. 1996b; Tsien et al. 1996). This promoter is active preferentially in excitatory neurons of forebrain areas, including the hippocampus, amygdala, cortex and striatum (Mayford et al. 1996a; Mayford et al. 1996b). It is also silent until several days after birth (Burgin et al. 1990), when most neural circuits are already formed, thereby possibly minimizing any adverse effects of the transgene on the normal development of the brain (Tsien et al. 1996). The PDE4B1 dominant-negative approach is designed to target just the PDE4B1 isoform and therefore has greater specificity than a Pde4b knockout. This specificity is the likely explanation for the differences in phenotype in PDE4B1 dominant-negative mice, compared to $P d e 4 b { - } / { - }$ mice. The PDE4B1 dominant-negative transgene clearly produces increased activity, levels of pCREB and neurogenesis, and may produce antidepressant effects in several assays (McGirr et al. 2016). One potential drawback of this approach is that the PDE4B1 dominant-negative transgene might not fully block PDE4B1 function, or, alternatively, might have some action against other PDE4 isoforms, including those encoded by the Pde4a and Pde4d genes. Despite these potential issues, the dominant-negative approach has merit and indeed appears to be best available way to study the relationship of a PDE4 isoform with its specific interacting partners, such as the interaction of PDE4B1 and DISC1.

There also appears to be some effect on learning and memory in many of the models. Augmented neurogenesis has been detected in almost all the models that have been assayed and provides a likely cellular mechanism for both the antidepressant and memory-augmentation phenotypes that have been observed. The antidepressant effects seem to be mediated more by pde4b isoforms, whereas the memory effects are mediated more by pde4d isoforms, although the relative contributions of these two genes are likely to overlap substantially. These results are generally reassuring for drug development: they provide essential confirmation that the CNS effects of PDE4-selective inhibitors are indeed produced by their ability to inhibit PDE4 enzymatic activity, and not by some as-yet-unappreciated off-target effect.

Intriguingly, a different set of PRKAR1A mutations have been detected in patients with acrodysostosis, a complex disorder affecting bone formation, growth and the CNS (Linglart et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2012; Linglart et al. 2012; Michot et al. 2012; Nagasaki et al. 2012; Muhn et al. 2013; Lindstrand et al. 2014). More recently, PDE4D mutations have been identified in patients with acrodysostosis that lack PRKAR1A mutations (Lee et al. 2012; Linglart et al. 2012; Michot et al. 2012; Lindstrand et al. 2014; Lynch et al. 2013). The skeletal dysplasia in patients with acrodysostosis with PRKAR1A mutations resembles the osteodystrophy seen in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism Type 1a, in that they are resistant to the action of the hormones PTH and TSH (Linglart et al. 2011; Linglart et al. 2012), two hormones that activate adenylyl cyclase through GPCRs. However, patients with PDE4D mutations do not demonstrate resistance to these hormones (Linglart et al. 2011; Linglart et al. 2012), consistent with the gene defect being in a different portion (PDE4D v PKA) of the cAMP signaling pathway.

The presence of intellectual disorders in PDE4D acrodysostosis patients has led a number of investigators to test for PDE4D mutations in a broader population of patients with mental retardation and skeletal abnormalities. These efforts have led to the recent study of a mirror phenotype, involving intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities different from acrodysostosis; genetic testing revealed PDE4D haploinsufficiency in these patients (Lindstrand et al. 2014). It seems quite likely that additional PDE4Dmutant syndromes affecting the CNS will be identified in the near future. ",

It is clear that the human phenotype is considerably more severe and affects multiple aspects of cognition and memory. Whether this reflects a purely species difference, or a different mutation mechanism (the acrodysostosis mutants may have a dominant-negative effect, as discussed below) is uncertain. There are no murine models of the acrodysostosis mutations; the CNS phenotype of the rat PDE4D−/− rat, which has skeletal abnormalities reminiscent of acrodysostosis, has yet to be published (Kaname et al. 2014).

Of the 16 different single amino acid acrodysostosis mutations that have been identified to date, 15 map to the interface between UCR1/2 and the catalytic domain, or to the “hinge” region connecting the dimerization domain to UCR1/2 and the catalytic domains (Cedervall et al. 2015). The 16th acrodysostosis mutation is at S133, the PKA catalytic site (Lindstrand et al. 2014); note that this and other genetic references use GenBank NM_001104631.1 for the mutation co-ordinates, with S133 in PDE4D5 being S190 in the GenBank entry.

Given that one of the acrodysostosis mutations is at the PKA phosphorylation site and completely blocks PKA phosphorylation of long PDE4D isoforms, and that all the PDE4D acrodysostosis mutations have a similar phenotype, it is quite possible that all PDE4D acrodysostosis mutations serve to inhibit PKA-mediated activation of PDE4D enzymatic activity, or lower PDE4D enzymatic activity in other ways (Kaname et al. 2014). Therefore, cAMP levels would be elevated in PDE4D acrodysostosis cells, activating PKA activity at its substrates and producing a potentially broad range of phenotypes. Consistent with this model is the observation of compensatory activation of other PDE4 isoforms (e.g., PDE4A and PDE4B) in acrodysostosis cells (Kaname et al. 2014). ",

It is possible that disorders of bone (or of the CNS) might be unanticipated side effects of PDE4 inhibition. To date, bone abnormalities (e.g., osteoporosis) have not been reported as a side effect of adult use of PDE4 inhibitors, however, exposure earlier in development (e.g., in utero) might produce profound skeletal development effects and remains a legitimate concern.

I propose that such agents should target the long PDE4 isoforms preferentially. Expression studies show that long forms are preferentially expressed in the CNS. Furthermore, only the long isoforms are capable of dimerization, with the corresponding change in enzymatic properties and the formation of a HARBS.  Indeed, it is generally agreed that CNS tissues are enriched in HARBS (Rocque et al. 1997a; Rocque et al. 1997b; Souness and Rao 1997; Zhang et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2003a; Zhao et al. 2003b).
