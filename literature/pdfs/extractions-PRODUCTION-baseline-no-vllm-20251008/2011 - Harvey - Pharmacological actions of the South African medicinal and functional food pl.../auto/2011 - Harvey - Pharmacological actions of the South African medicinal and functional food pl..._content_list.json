        "text": "Sceletium tortuosum is a succulent plant which is indigenous to South Africa and belongs to the family Mesembryanthemaceae (Smith et al., 1996; Klak et al., 2007). It has a long history of traditional use, and more recently, it has attracted attention for its possible utility in supporting and promoting a sense of wellbeing in healthy people, and treating people with anxiety, stress or depression (for review see Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). Eight species of Sceletium are generally recognised (S. crassicaule, S. emarcidum, S. exalatum, S. expansum, S. rigidum, S. strictum, S. tortuosum and S. varians), although Klak et al. (2007) suggested that the Sceletium group is more properly classified as: Mesembryanthemum crassicaule, M. emarcidum, M. exalatum, M. expansum, M. archeri $\\mathrm { \\cdot } = S .$ rigidum), M. ladismithiense $\\mathrm { \\partial } = S .$ strictum), M. tortuosum and M. varians. The chemistry of various Sceletium species has been extensively studied, although the focus appears to have been exclusively on alkaloids: The Dictionary of Natural Products (2011) gives details of 31 different alkaloidal components from five sources of Sceletium (S. joubertii, S. namaquense [both now placed under synonomy with S. tortuosum],  S. strictum, S. subvelutium [also now within the species concept of S. tortuosum],  and S. tortuosum).  Sceletium tortuosum is known to contain at least mesembrine, mesembranol, mesembrenol, mesembrenone, alkaloid A4, chennaine and tortuosamine (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). ",

        "text": "Despite the interest in the possible use of Sceletium extracts or alkaloids in medicinal and dietary supplements, very little experimental pharmacological work has been published. Mesembrine, isolated from Sceletium tortuosum, was shown to be a potent inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake (US Patent, 2001), and this was confirmed with synthetic $( - )$ -mesembrine. Its $\\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ against 5-HT uptake was $2 7 \\mathrm { n M }$ , with much weaker effects on noradrenaline uptake $( \\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } \\sim 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M } )$ and no effect on dopamine uptake at $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). Mesembrenone has been tested for cytotoxic effects on three cell lines (Weniger et al., 1995). It was found to affect a human T cell lymphoma line (Molt4 cells) with an $\\mathsf { E C } _ { 5 0 }$ of ${ \\sim } 2 \\mu \\mu$ $( 0 . 6 \\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { m l } )$ , but to have little effect on a hepatoma cell line (Hep G2) or on a mouse fibroblast line (LMTK cells; $\\mathrm { E C } _ { 5 0 } \\ 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { g / m l } ^ { \\cdot }$ ). Mesembrine and synthetic analogues were shown to inhibit phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) activity (Napoletano et al., 2001). Mesembrine itself was a very weak PDE4 inhibitor $( \\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 } 2 9 \\mu \\mathrm { M } )$ but some synthetic analogues were considerably more active, with $\\mathrm { I C } _ { 5 0 }$ ’s of $0 . 1 \\mathrm { - } 1 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ .

The authors also reported that the plant material had beneficial effects in cats with signs of stress and dogs showing signs clinically diagnosed as dementia. The latter effects were reported to be confirmed in a more extensive study on dogs (Hirai et al., 2005). More recently, a Sceletium extract was tested in rats in an immobilisation stress model (Smith, 2011) where it was found to have positive effects on psychological stress.

        "text": "There is interest in the possible use of Sceletium preparations in functional foods, beverages and supplements for promoting health and wellness in healthy people, in people experiencing stress, and for treating people with a variety of psychological and psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). Despite the long documented history of the plant being used as a masticatory, health tea, and as a herbal medicine, there are few reports on its pharmacological activity (Smith et al., 1996). Its claimed effectiveness in cases of depression has been linked to inhibitory effects on 5-HT reuptake (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008), although such effects have not been extensively studied. The present results demonstrate that the proprietary standardised extract of Sceletium tortuosum known as Zembrin® does have potent inhibitory effects on the 5-HT transporter. Considering that a plant extract will have several hundred components, it is perhaps surprising that the Sceletium extract affected so few sites in the extensive panel of receptors, ion channels, transporters and enzymes used in this study. Potent inhibitory activity was also found against PDE4 and, to a lesser extent, PDE3, but not to other PDEs. There were also significant reductions in binding of radioligands at a few receptors: GABA receptors, $\\delta _ { 2 }$ - opioid receptors, $\\mu$ -opioid receptors, cholecystokinin-1 (or -A) receptors, EP4 prostaglandin receptors and melatonin-1 receptors. However, the concentrations needed were 30–150 times greater than those needed with the 5-HT transporter assays. Consequently, clinical effects of extract Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin®) are likely to stem from their inhibitory effects on 5-HT uptake processes and PDE4 activity. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are well-known as antidepressants, and PDE4 inhibitors have also attracted considerable attention as potential antidepressants, although the pharmaceutical compounds tested clinically have had dose-limiting side effects of nausea and emesis (Kanes et al., 2007). There is substantial experimental evidence from animal models that PDE4 inhibitors can reverse depression, improve cognition and alleviate anxiety (O’Donnell and Zhang, 2004; Rutten et al., 2006). There is also a positive finding in an animal test of a PDE4 inhibitor relating to schizophrenia (Kanes et al., 2007), and there is evidence for a synergistic effect of PDE4 inhibition combined with monoamine-uptake inhibitors (Fujimaki et al., 1999). Therefore, the finding that the extract Sceletium tortuosum Zembrin® was a powerful inhibitor of both 5-HT uptake and PDE4 activity could be highly significant in terms of its health application in humans. Recently, the therapeutic advantages of dual 5-HT uptake inhibition and PDE4 inhibition have been discussed (Cashman et al., 2009), and include the possibility of using a lower dose to achieve enhanced efficacy with a reduced side-effect profile.
