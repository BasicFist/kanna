        "text": "Mesembryanthemum tortuosum L. (synonym Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E.Br.), a succulent subshrub indigenous to South Africa, belongs to the family Mesembryanthemaceae (Smith et al., 1996). It is mainly distributed in the Karroid areas of the Cape region of South Africa and is locally referred to as “kanna” or “canna” (Khoi) and “kougoed” (Afrikaans) (Shikanga et al., 2012b). M. tortuosum is traditionally used to treat central nervous system (CNS) conditions, such as depression, stress, anxiety, and as a masticatory drug for the relief of thirst and hunger (Shikanga et al., 2012a,b). Recently, a $^ 1 \\mathrm { H }$ NMR and UPLC–MS based metabolomic study, exploring chemotypic variation in S. tortuosum from two provinces in South Africa, was reported (Zhao et al., 2018). Alkaloids, commonly referred to as “mesembrine type alkaloids” (mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol and mesembranol), are recognized as the major chemical and bioactive constituents responsible for the psychoactive activities of the plant (Carpenter et al., 2016; Loria et al., 2014; Shikanga et al., 2012a, 2011, 2012b; Smith et al., 1996). As few alkaloids have been reported from this psychoactive plant species so far, we decided to investigate it further for its undiscovered phytoconstituents. The current phytochemical investigation of M. tortuosum resulted in the isolation and characterization of two novel alkaloids, sceletorine A (1) and sceletorine B (2), which are shown to have unusual carbon architecture (Fig. 1). Their structures and absolute configurations (ACs) were determined by the analysis of extensive spectroscopic data and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Interestingly, compound 2 appears to be a precursor of channaine, which was reported as an artifact originating from the condensation of pair of $N$ -desmethylmesembrenone molecules in 1978 by Jeffs et al. from S. strictum (Abou-Donia et al., 1978) and recently isolated and characterized on the basis of NMR from M. tortuosum (Veale et al., 2018). The possibility of compounds 1 and 2 to be the artifacts formed during acid-base extraction and/or isolation procedures was ruled out by observing their presence in the freshly prepared methanol extract of the plant by HPLC (see Supplementary file). Herein, the isolation, structure elucidation, stereochemical assignment, and plausible biosynthetic pathways of these alkaloids are presented. ",

The molecular formula of 1 was determined to be $\\mathrm { C _ { 3 3 } H _ { 4 0 } N _ { 2 } O _ { 5 } }$ by its $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ NMR data and positive HRESIMS, which showed a $[ \\mathbf { M } + \\mathbf { H } ] ^ { + }$ ion peak at $m / z 5 4 5 . 3 0 2 6$ (calcd for $\\mathrm { C _ { 3 3 } H _ { 4 1 } N _ { 2 } O _ { 5 } }$ , 545.3015). The $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ NMR and HSQC spectra analysis revealed that 1 possessed 33 carbons, including five methyls, eight methylenes, nine methines, and 11 nonprotonated carbons, out of which 15 were olefinic/aromatic carbons. The resonance at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 211.3 was due to a carbonyl group. The NMR resonances (Table 1) at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } 2 . 3 2$ (3H, s), and $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 3 9 . 8$ were ascribed to a methyl group on the nitrogen atom. The resonances at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } ~ 7 . 1 1$ (1 H), 7.04 (1 H), 6.94 (1 H), 6.86 (3 H), 3.89 (s, 3 H), 3.93 (s, 9 H) and at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 149.6, 148.9, 147.9, 147.7, 139.0, 135.8, 118.8, 118.7, 111.5, 111.1, 110.3, 110.0, 56.2, 56.0, 56.0, 55.9 in $^ 1 \\mathrm { H }$ or $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ NMR spectra suggested the presence of two 3, 4- dimethoxyphenyl groups, the typical aryl moiety for mesembrine type alkaloids (Bastida et al., 1989; Chavan et al., 2004), which was further supported by the detailed HMBC correlations (Fig. 2). The aforementioned resonances implied that 1 could be a dimeric alkaloid, which was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H-7ʹ $( \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } 3 . 8 6 )$ with C-4, C-5, C6; $\\mathrm { \\Delta H - } 7 \\mathrm { a } ^ { \\prime }$ $( \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } ~ 2 . 7 6 ~ \\$ , dd, $J = 6 . 9$ , ${ 1 5 . 8 } \\mathrm { H z } \\mathrm { ) }$ with C-5; $\\mathrm { H } { - } 2 ^ { \\prime }$ $( \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } ~ 3 . 8 2$ and 3.68, brd, $J = 1 8 . 6 \\mathrm { H z } \\mathrm { , }$ with C-6; and H-4 ( $\\cdot \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } \\ 5 . 9 5$ , s) to C-7ʹ. Determination of the relative configuration at each stereogenic center of 1 was achieved with NOESY experiment in benzene- $d _ { 6 }$ . The correlations between H-7a with H-9/H-13 are in agreement with mesembrine alkaloid type cis ring fusion. Whereas, NOESY correlations of H-7ʹ with H$9 ^ { \\prime } / \\mathrm { H } \\mathrm { - } 1 3 ^ { \\prime }$ and H-4 (olefinic) with $\\mathrm { H } – 7 \\mathbf { a } ^ { \\prime }$ and $\\mathrm { H } { - } 9 / \\mathrm { H } { - } 1 3$ indicated that both aryl groups, $\\mathrm { H } { - } 7 \\mathbf { a }$ , and H-7ʹ placed on same side of the plane, implying that the absolute configuration (AC) of compound 1 might be either $3 \\mathrm { a } R , 7 \\mathrm { a } S , 3 \\mathrm { a } ^ { \\prime } S , 7 ^ { \\prime } S \\mathrm { - }$ or $3 \\mathrm { a } S , 7 \\mathrm { a } R , 3 \\mathrm { a } ^ { \\prime } R , 7 ^ { \\prime } R \\mathrm { . }$ - (Fig. 3).

Fifty-two conformers of 2a and 42 conformers of 2c were relocated at the B3LYP $\\mathbf { \\langle 6 { - } 3 1 1 + + 6 ^ { * * } }$ level in the gas phase, both with very broad distribution (Tables S2 and S3). The weighted ECD spectrum of configuration 2a overall matches the experimental ECD curve, whereas that of 2c does not, even though noticeable redshift was found in the simulated ECD spectrum of 2a for the experimental CEs at 235 and $2 5 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ (Fig. 7). The experimentally negative CEs at 205 and $2 3 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ were reproduced at 202 and $2 5 4 \\mathrm { n m }$ , respectively, whereas those positive CEs at 217 and $2 5 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ correspond to the simulated ones at 227 and $2 7 9 \\mathrm { n m }$ , respectively. Therefore, the AC of compound 2 was assigned as $3 \\mathrm { a } S , 7 \\mathrm { a } S , 3 \\mathrm { a } ^ { \\prime } R , 4 ^ { \\prime } R , 7 \\mathrm { a } ^ { \\prime } S$ (2a) (Fig. 8). ",

        "text": "A plausible biogenetic route towards the unique dimer (1) formation may be initiated by oxidative keto-enamine coupling of mesembrine with a N-desmethylmesembrine unit(Guo et al., 2012) to yield a tetracyclic intermediate. A proton rearrangement followed by an allylic oxidation and a subsequent elimination of a water molecule results in compound 1 (Scheme 1). Similar to compound 1, the pentacyclic compound 2 could be envisioned from intramolecular Michael addition of (desmethyl)mesembrine enolate to the $N$ -demethylmesembrenone (Guo et al., 2012), via enamine/iminium intermediate. Further, possible P450 mediated allylic oxidation (when $\\mathrm { R } { = } \\mathrm { H } \\dot { , }$ ), followed by a rearrangement of the hydroxyl group could yield amino-enone, aminol or hemiacetal, channaine (Scheme 1). Based on the results along with the proposed biogenesis for these dimeric alkaloids, it was speculated that the possible intermolecular condensation of monomeric mesembrine alkaloids as well as cytochrome P450 mediated secondary oxidations are plausible in M. tortuosum. Moreover, the optical rotation of these two dimeric alkaloids, conserved a stereopreference at the bicyclic bridge and their presence in freshly prepared extract indicate that these compounds are not artifacts of extraction/isolation procedures. Indeed, they are natural secondary metabolites of mesembrinetype mono alkaloids present in M. tortuosum. Nonetheless, the current findings highlight the complex chemistry of M. tortuosum wherein the major mono alkaloids are used as building blocks for the formation of novel, unique scaffolds. ",
