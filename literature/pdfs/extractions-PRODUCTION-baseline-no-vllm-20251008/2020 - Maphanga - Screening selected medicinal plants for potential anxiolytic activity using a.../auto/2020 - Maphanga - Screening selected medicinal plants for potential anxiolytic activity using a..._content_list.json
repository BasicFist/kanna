        "text": "Anxiety is an intense or overwhelming feeling which threatens psychological and physical well-being (Sousa et al. 2015). When the feeling of anxiety continues far beyond the presence of the stimulus and disrupts normal functioning it is defined as an anxiety disorder. The intensity and duration may differ from one person to the other and reach a point where it affects normal daily functioning (Koda-Kimble et al. 2012). According to Romana and co-workers (Romana et al. 2017), the neurobiology of anxiety disorder is unknown. However, anxiety, like other psychiatric disorders including depression and mood disorders, is linked to neurotransmitter imbalances within the central nervous system (CNS). Four neurotransmitters play a major role in mood regulation; serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and norepinephrine. The most widespread neurotransmitter is glutamate, which is assisted by three catecholamines, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Inhibitory neurotransmitters include GABA, glycine, and serotonin. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, which assists neurons to recover after impulse transmission and in so doing reducing stress and anxiety, particularly after excessive stimulation.. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are also regulated by GABA in decreasing the excitability in the neural transmission chain (Romana et al. 2017). Anxiolytic drugs encompass a number of drug classes; the barbiturates are no longer used due to their narrow therapeutic index and potential for toxicity; benzodiazepines and their derivatives are commonly used to treat anxiety but also have undesirable effects such as sedation and their propensity to produce dependence; a third major class is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs, but often initially worsen anxiety and have a delayed onset of action (Benneh et al. 2017).

        "text": "Available anxiety treatment is expensive, is very often not ideal due to side effects, and has to be individualized for every patient (Bandelow et al. 2008). There are an increasing number of individuals who prefer using complementary and alternative medicines in the treatment of physical and psychiatric symptoms (Van der Watt et al. 2008). Most patients believe that complementary medicines cause fewer side effects than allopathic medicines and complementary alternatives are often less expensive (Bandelow et al. 2008). Furthermore, traditional medicines are still an integral part of culture and customs in many countries, especially in the majority of African communities (Fennell et al. 2004). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2000, $7 0 – 9 5 \\%$ of the population in developing countries still use traditional medicines. The knowledge of using traditional medicine has been passed on from one generation to the next based on cognitive features, ecological factors, and cultural history (Leonti 2011). These indigenous knowledge systems emphasize the advantages of ethnopharmacologically guided bioprospecting to conserve both the medicinal plant resources as well as the healerexpert cultural wisdom and to facilitate culturally relevant health promotion (Pesek et al. 2009).

The zebrafish has been used for decades as an animal model for biomedical research, especially in developmental and genetic studies (Zon and Peterson 2005). The zebrafish, which has shares a highly homologous genome with vertebrate species (rodents and humans), as well as brain modeling, structure, and function, provides the added advantages of high fecundity, small size and allows rapid high-volume cost-effective screening. Furthermore, zebrafish have numerous neural and physiological systems (stress regulating system) in common with vertebrates (Burne et al. 2011; Guo 2004, 2009; Lieschke and Currie 2007) and share with them some key receptors that play an important role in the etiology of neurological disorders (Guo 2004). The model is ideally suited for large-scale analysis as hundreds of fertilized eggs can be harvested daily, 4 to 5-dpf larvae demonstrate a broad range of behaviors, and their small size allows for easy handling (Schnörr et al. 2012).

The animal’s choice between the dark or bright side of a chamber demonstrates changes in anxiety level. This test, together with the open field exploration test, was adapted to the zebrafish model (Belzung and Grieble 2001; Ramcharitar and Ibrahim 2013). Locomotion and thigmotaxis are two important parameters in the zebrafish model that are indicative of anxiety levels. Additionally, light-dark transitions also elevate anxiety levels in the fish (Blaser et al. 2010; Maximino et al. 2010). Thigmotaxis (a preference for peripheral areas of the tank or well) is a behavioral endpoint commonly used to measure anxiety. Rodents were commonly used before this behavior was successfully adapted to a number of models, including 5- dpf zebrafish larvae. The zebrafish larvae demonstrate thigmotaxis by avoiding the central arena and moving to the peripheral areas of a novel environment (Schnörr et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2009; Treit and Fundytus 1988). The assessment of thigmotaxis behavior is dependent on adequate physical exploration of all spatial zones (centre and periphery) of a novel environment (Bouwknecht and Paylor 2008; Schnörr et al. 2012).

Anxiety in humans is characterized by restlessness and increased motor activity (Sousa et al. 2015). Neurobehavioral animal models such as zebrafish larvae are well suited to study anxiety as they have well-developed systems for locomotor activity (Ji et al. 2017). It has been proven that light-dark transitions (stressful situations) affect the locomotor activity of the zebrafish larvae and the transition from light to darkness induces hyper-locomotion as a result of increased stress/ anxiety level (Peng et al. 2016).

        "text": "Plant extracts are well known to be complex mixtures of unknown composition. Torres-Hernandez and colleagues (Torres-Hernández et al. 2016) demonstrated the robustness and sensitivity of zebrafish larvae to plant extracts in order to verify their psychoactive efficacy. In the current study, extracts which were shown to exhibit no toxic effects on zebrafish larvae were screened for anxiolytic activity. As outlined from literature, all plants listed in Tables 1 and 2 were reported as having anxiolytic activity. However, in this study Sceletium tortuosum demonstrated the highest anxiolytic activity as compared with other extracts. Different concentrations of Sceletium tortuosum demonstrated anxiolytic activity (reverse-thigmotaxis) on the zebrafish larvae when spontaneous locomotor activity and light-dark transitions were considered. The water extract of Sceletium tortuosum had a significant anxiolytic effect on the zebrafish larvae at the 12.5 and $2 5 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ concentrations during the $4 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ of continuous illumination as compared with the control group. Over the years Sceletium tortuosum has been recognized as a plant of interest due to its anti-stress effects in healthy individuals as well as alleviating a wide-ranging of psychological and psychiatric disorders (Gericke and Van Wyk 2001; Gericke and Viljoen 2008; Shikanga et al. 2013). The results obtained were compared with other studies where either rodents or other mammals were used to study the anti-anxiety/stress effects of Sceletium tortuosum. An example of one such study is that conducted by Smith (2011). One of the most interesting observations in this study was that Sceletium tortuosum reduced the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in rats. Normally IL-2 increases in response to stress, thereby activating the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA-axis), which in turn produces hormones, which are responsible for reducing stress. Furthermore, IL-2 levels were higher in low-dose Sceletium tortuosum treated rats but lower in higher-dose–treated rats. This suggested that this extract might have had a similar effect on the zebrafish larvae; hence, higher anxiolytic activity was observed in low-dose extract–treated groups. The zebrafish has both the brain sympathetic-chromaffin cell axis and hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal (HPI) axis, which functions in a similar manner to the sympathetic–adrenal and hypothalamic– pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis found in higher vertebrates like humans. The anatomy, connectivity, and molecular elements of the HPA (higher vertebrates) and HPI (fish) share a homologous functional organization and physiology in terms of stress response (Bonga 1997; Alsop and Vijayan 2008, 2009). As compared with human beings, zebrafish react towards stressful situations via increased levels of cortisol (Bonga 1997; Ramsay et al. 2009; Verbeek et al. 2008). Furthermore, neurotransmitters such as serotonin play a major role in anxiety. Serotonin is one of the most widespread neurotransmitters and has numerous behavioral functions (Lowry and Hale 2010; Maximino et al. 2012, 2013; Robbins and Crockett 2010). Moreover, the synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin 1A receptor $( 5 \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { H T _ { 1 A } } )$ , and serotonin transporter were found to be similar in zebrafish to higher vertebrates (Bellipanni et al. 2002; Maximino et al. 2013; Norton et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2006). Certain regions homologous to the amygdala, in zebrafish such as the dorsomedial, pre- and post-commissural ventral telencephali, and the periventricular gray zone of the tectum (Maximino et al. 2013; Norton et al. 2008) are triggered following exposure of zebrafish to the light/dark transitions and are linked with fear and anxiety behavior (Lau et al. 2011). However, there are differences between the serotonergic system of zebrafish and mammals. Nonetheless, the therapeutic effects of drugs on targeted proteins are closely related between these vertebrates (Maximino et al. 2013). Sceletium tortuosum produces mesembrine-type alkaloids (mesembranol, mesembrenol, mesembrine, and mesembrenone) as secondary metabolites; these alkaloids are responsible for the anxiolytic activity (Shikanga et al. 2013; Smith et al. 1996). Additionally, these alkaloids inhibit serotonin-reuptake and phosphodiester-4 (PDE-4) enzyme, thus treating a variety of central nervous system–related disorders (Gericke and Viljoen 2008; Harvey et al. 2011). The results of this study justify further research into the anxiolytic activity of these alkaloids using an in vivo zebrafish model. ",
