N.E.Br., the most sought after and widely researched species in the genus Sceletium is a succulent forb endemic to South Africa. Traditionally, this medicinal plant is mainly masticated or smoked and used for the relief of toothache, abdominal pain, as a mood-elevator, analgesic, hypnotic, anxiolytic, thirst and hunger suppressant, and for its intoxicating/euphoric effects. Sceletium tortuosum is currently of widespread scientific interest due to its clinical potential in treating anxiety and depression, relieving stress in healthy individuals, and enhancing cognitive functions. These pharmacological actions are attributed to its phytochemical constituents referred to as mesembrine-type alkaloids. ",

The calyx has four or five sepals, and fruits are 10–15 mm in diameter and open when wet. The fruit capsule contains several kidney-shaped seeds that are brown to black in colour (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). The genus is distributed in the south-western parts of South Africa, from Namaqualand to Montagu through to Aberdeen, and commonly occurs in quartz patches (Fig. 2). It is usually found growing under shrubs in partial shade and has an affinity for arid environments (Chesselet, 2005). Although S. tortuosum shares numerous morpholog­ ical traits with other species in the genus, it is usually distinguished from other species by comparing the flower, seed, fruit, and vegetative characteristics (Shikanga et al., 2013; Appleton, 2021).

The first known written account of the plant’s use, referred to as Kanna, was in 1662 by Jan van Riebeeck. According to Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), S. tortuosum is used as a narcotic, and farmers in the Cape used it as a decoction or a tincture and as a sedative. The narcotic effect is claimed to be much more pronounced after fermentation (Smith et al., 1996; Chen and Viljoen, 2019a). The leaf is also chewed to relieve toothache and abdominal pain (Yin et al., 2019) and as a hunger and thirst suppressant during hunting trips (Gericke, 2020). The following was an early statement describing the clinical effects observed after S. tortuosum plant material was chewed: “Zwicky chewed $_ { 5 g }$ of ‘kougoed’, the result being a bitter, astringent taste and an inclination to vomit, tingling of the tongue followed by weak and fairly persistent analgesia of the mouth, the pulse remaining normal.” (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). The traditionally prepared dried Sceletium was often chewed and the liquid from it swallowed, but it has also been prepared into tablets, gel caps, teas, and tinctures. It is also used as a snuff and smoked (Meyer et al., 2015). In pregnant women, S. tortuosum is usually chewed to treat constipation, indigestion and nausea. An infusion of S. tortuosum is taken to contract the uterus, exorcize any residual after birth, and to relieve abdominal pain in women who have just given birth (Gericke, 2018). Additionally, oil extracted from the fried mix of S. tortuosum and the end portion of a sheep’s tail is given to relieve colic in babies (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Gericke, 2018). ",

According to Gericke and Viljoen (2008), Zwicky was the first to isolate and identify mesembrine and mesembrenine in S. tortuosum. However, the chemical structures were later corrected by Popelak and Lettenbauer (1967). While Snyckers et al. (1971) reported the structures of a partial racemic Sceletium alkaloid and tortuosamine, Jeffs et al. (1982) confirmed the structure of mesembrine and listed two additional unidentified ketonic alkaloids, which remained unidentified. Only in 1998 did Smith et al. (1998) identify mesembrenol, mesembrine and mesembrenone in fermented S. tortuosum. Patnala and Kanfer (2009a) investigated the trans­ formation of alkaloids during fermentation. They reproduced the fermentation process of S. tortuosum and included the fermentation of pure mesembrine hydrochloride under controlled conditions, including exposure to sunlight and fermentation at ambient and elevated tem­ peratures. They found that mesembrine transformed into mesem­ brenone, with the mesembrine concentration decreasing from $1 . 3 3 \\%$ to $0 . 0 5 \\%$ , and mesembrenone increasing from below the limit of detection to $0 . 1 1 \\%$ .

In 2018, the chemical structure of a new alkaloid was reported. This compound, channaine, was tentatively identified in 1978, but the full structure elucidation was only recently published (Veale et al., 2018). Yin et al.

The structures and absolute configu­ rations of the two compounds were determined by extensive spectro­ scopic data and electronic circular dichroism. The results of the study revealed that sceletorine B might be a precursor of channaine, which had been previously isolated and characterized by Veale et al. (2018).

Patnala and Kanfer (2008) developed a capillary zone electrophoresis method to quantify mesembrine in Sceletium tab­ lets. Shikanga et al.

The HPTLC method was validated, and the results obtained from sample analysis correlated well with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. In the same year, the same research group published a validated method using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) with a reversed-phase column and photodiode array (PDA) detection to quantify the four alkaloids in S. tortuosum (Shikanga et al., 2012c). Roscher et al. (2012) developed a nonaqueous chemical electrophoresis (NACE) mass spectrometry (MS) method for the separation and quan­ tification of alkaloids in a S. tortuosum extract. Manda et al. (2015) developed and validated a sensitive UHPLC-MS method for the accurate quantification of mesembrenone and mesembrine in mouse plasma. Freund et al. (2018) developed a leaf spray MS technique in order to facilitate the rapid detection of plant metabolites without using chro­ matography. Fresh leaf material of S. tortuosum was analyzed, and the major mesembrine alkaloids were detected with the MS method. Lesiak et al. (2016) characterized S. tortuosum directly using real-time ioniza­ tion coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight (HRTOF) mass spec­ trometry (MS). This method identified the material as S. tortuosum, but at the same time, it identified a scheduled substance (in this case, the stimulant ephedrine), which has been banned in herbal products and supplements.

This dosage range was selected to coincide with the clinical literature described below. Zembrin $^ { \\mathrm { \\textregistered } }$ was compared to the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant, escitalopram (ESC) oxalate (5, 10, or $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g } )$ , both administered via oral gavage. Flinders Sensitive Line rats showed significant depressive-like behav­ iour, viz. decreased swimming and climbing (coping) behaviors, and significantly increased immobility (despair), versus Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) control rats. Escitalopram oxalate $5 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ and Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ at $2 5 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ and $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ showed significant dose-dependent reversal of immobility (anti-depressant effects) in FSL rats and variable effects on coping behaviors. Closer scrutiny found Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ at $5 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ to be the most effective antidepressant dose, with equivalence to $5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ ESC. However, in an associated chronic treatment study over 15 days (Ger­ icke, 2020), neither treatment alone showed a significant antidepressant-like effect in the FST, which warrants further study. Nevertheless, the antidepressant response to acute but not chronic Zembrin coincides with similar findings with S. tortuosum in the chick anxiety-depression model (Fountain (2016). That said, chronic treat­ ment studies showed that the combination of S. tortuosum at $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ and ESC at $5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ significantly increased hippocampal levels of se­ rotonin, noradrenaline, as well as increased locomotor activity (Gericke, 2020). Furthermore, treatment with Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ $5 0 \\mathrm { ~ \\ m g / k g }$ alone) showed a significant increase in hippocampal brain-derived neuro­ trophic factor (BDNF). The above-mentioned monoaminergic and neu­ rotrophin effects are positive indices in major depressive disorder treatment (Brand et al., 2015), while also indicating improved neuro­ plasticity with possible procognitive effects, which warrants further study That an antidepressant response to Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ could only be confirmed following acute, but not chronic treatment, may be due to the model used (viz. FSL rat), advocating further studies using other trans­ lational models. ",

(2020), seven medicinal plants reported in literature that are used in traditional medicine in treating anxiety and other central nervous system conditions were identified, selected and evaluated for their potential anxiolytic effects using an in vivo zebrafish assay. The plants used for the study are Xysmalobium undulatum, Withania somnifera, Sutherlandia frutescens, Sceletium tortuo­ sum, Piper methysticum, Mondia whitei and Melia azedarach. Four different crude extracts (viz: distilled water, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and methanol) of the plants were prepared, and the maximum tolerated concentration (MTC) of the extracts was determined before the anxio­ lytic activity assay. Anxiety was induced in 5-day-post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae using continuous illumination and alternating light-dark challenges. Determination of MTC values revealed that 13 of the 28 extracts tested were toxic, hence larvae were only treated with 15 non-toxic extracts at the dose that was determined in the MTC assay. Diazepam and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served as the positive and negative control, respectively. Reverse-thigmotaxis behaviour, which indicates anxiolytic activity, and general locomotor activity were analyzed in anxiety-induced zebrafish larvae. The results showed that S. tortuosum water extract of the 15 non-toxic extracts demonstrated the highest anxiolytic activity. Hence, S. tortuosum water extract was further evaluated for detailed behavioral effects. The result revealed that different tested concentrations of S. tortuosum water extract showed anxiolytic activity (reverse-thigmotaxis) on the zebrafish larvae when light-dark transitions and spontaneous locomotor activity were consid­ ered. Furthermore, during the 40 minutes of continuous illumination challenge, S. tortuosum water extract showed significant anxiolytic ac­ tivity at two concentrations (12.5 and $2 5 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ ) on the zebrafish larvae when compared with the control group (DMSO treated group). Collec­ tively, the results indicate the therapeutic potentials of S. tortuosum in managing anxiety. ",

The study was a 2-part research design that employed a placebo-controlled and double-blind between-subject experimental approach. A feeling of anxiety/stress was induced in subjects through a 20-min multitasking framework in study 1, and a 5-min simulated public speaking assay in study 2. Subjective experiences of mood, pre-stress induction, and post-stress induction were measured in the first part of the study. In the second part of the study, subjective experiences of anxiety, heart rate, and galvanic skin response at baseline, pre-stress, during-stress, and post-stress inductions were measured. There was no treatment effect in the first part of the study, and the lack of observable effect was attrib­ uted to a mild stressor, which disallowed observable treatment effects in subjective self-report measures. In the second study, however, Zem­ $\\mathrm { b r i n } \\ @$ caused a reduction in subjective anxiety levels. It was concluded that a single $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g }$ dose of Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ could ameliorate subjective and physiological indicators of anxiety/stress in healthy volunteers. This study suggests possible application in the treatment of stress and anxiety-related conditions. ",

Compared with placebo, S. tortuosum extract significantly improved complex reactive tasks that required subjects to respond to repeated visual stimuli with a cognitive load. However, supplementation with the extract on the subjects had no benefits on mood. Previous studies that reported improved mood with S. tortuosum extract supplementation were conducted in older adults who may be more sensitive to cognitive enhancement from 5-HT and PDE4 inhibition.

This is also applicable to the delivery of biologically active molecules from S. tortuosum to the brain. Fortunately, the olfactory re­ gion in the nose provides a platform for direct nose-to-brain delivery of molecules and thereby avoiding the blood-brain barrier (Bahadur and Pathak, 2012). Planned research will explore the rate and extent of delivery of mesembrine alkaloids in S. tortuosum extract across excised sheep olfactory and respiratory nasal epithelial tissues. This study will indicate if the active molecules from S. tortuosum extract can be deliv­ ered rapidly and directly into the brain via the nasal route of adminis­ tration and thereby giving immediate relief (e.g. rapid treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms).

However, given that the clinical management of depression requires chronic and not acute treatment for sustained efficacy, for more translational relevance pre-clinical studies need to be undertaken using validated translational models, such as the FSL rat, using a chronic treatment regimen followed by appropriate bio-marker analysis. We have also noted earlier that differences in acute versus chronic antidepressant response, for example to Zembrin®, may be dependent on the model used, thereby advocating further studies on S. tortuosum using other translational animal models such as the chronic mild stress model.

Old generation groups of antidepressants such as tricyclic anti­ depressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and selec­ tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain the primary treatment for the disorder (Brand et al., 2015). Although the majority of the patient diagnosed with MDD respond well to clinical antidepressant treatment, $1 0 { - } 3 0 \\%$ of patients do not improve and go on to display further symp­ toms of depression (Al-Harbi, 2012). Multiple mechanisms are impli­ cated in the pathophysiology of MDD (Brand et al., 2015). Therefore, a strategy of using antidepressants with dual-or triple action as first-line treatment, or to augment first-line treatment with agents with multi­ ple modes of action (Dupuy et al., 2011), will allow the simultaneous targeting of deficits in central brain monoamines, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroinflammation, impaired neuroplasticity, genetic predisposition, and environmental influences, among others (Brand et al., 2015). Indeed, different symp­ toms of depression may be targeted by specifically addressing specific pathological processes in other regions of the brain, and in this way improve long-term outcomes. By virtue of its multi-mode of action (Table 3), S. tortuosum is indeed attractive as a possible augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). As noted earlier, the presence of different chemotypes of S. tortuosum are relevant here. Assessment in specific translational animal models of TRD (Brand and Harvey, 2017) are recommended as proof of concept before clinical assessment. It also needs to be borne in mind that commercial avail­ ability of complementary medicines often sees herbal preparations being used without medical supervision, even in combination with prescribed treatments (Ravindran and Da Silva, 2013). This poses a serious risk for possible drug interactions and toxicity, e.g. serotonin syndrome when SSRIs are co-administered with for instance Saint John’s wort (Sarris, 2018). Given the serotonergic actions of ST (Table 4) (Harvey et al., 2011), and similar supportive evidence from our laboratory (Gericke, 2020), such studies need to be undertaken. These real-world issues, plus that plant constituents may have interacting effects with one another, warrant dedicated research into the pharmacokinetic and pharmaco­ logical profiles of herbal medicines (Sarris, 2018). Such studies need to be carried out with S. tortuosum. ",

        "text": "Methamphetamine (MA) is the world’s third most abused illicit substance, after cannabis and opioids (United Nations, 2020). The consequences of MA abuse are dire, including high rates of morbidity and mortality (Herbeck et al., 2015), yet there is currently no approved treatment for MA addiction (Olsen and Liu, 2016; Shahidi et al., 2019). Its primary psychoactive and addictive effects are mediated through an increase in mesolimbic dopamine levels (Kish, 2008), through inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) (Lüscher, 2015). Moreover, MA also increases other monoamines such as noradrenaline and serotonin (Kish, 2008), through inhibition of the noradrenaline transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (SERT); (Lüscher, 2015), leading to feelings of alertness, energy, and euphoria (Panenka et al., 2013). Methamphet­ amine also influences inflammatory pathways, via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)- phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)- cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signal cascade (or cAMP-PDE4-CREB signal cascade); (Olsen and Liu, 2016), leading to a pro-inflammatory state. By displaying dual inhibitory effects on SERT and PDE4, as well as its anti-inflammatory (Loria et al., 2014), S. tortuosum may be an interesting candidate with potential in treating MA addiction. Indeed, S. tortuosum has shown concentration-dependent activity at neuronal receptors known to be involved in addiction, e.g. mu- and delta-opioid receptors (Harvey et al., 2011; Loria et al., 2014; Carpenter et al., 2016). Pre-clinical animal models of addiction may be especially suit­ able for addressing this question (Kalivas et al., 2006). These models can be specially adapted to examine S. tortuosum co-administered with MA, specifically addressing the development of addiction, or administered post MA exposure (viz. during MA withdrawal), which more explores the treatment of symptom manifestation of MA addiction. A recent animal study considered whether Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ could modify the behav­ ioral and neurochemical profile of MA (Postma, 2021). The authors concluded that in this context and model, the monoaminergic actions of Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ as described earlier, acts as a stimulant during MA exposure. This is not unlike the pro-dopaminergic actions of anti-addictive agents like bupropion (Postma, 2021), and hints at its possible utility as an anti-addictive agent. However, further investigation into the mechanism of action of Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ during addictive states is needed, and whether it is capable of reversing psychotogenic drug-induced addictive-like behaviour.

Evidently, these distressing statistics highlight the severity of this global disorder (Bueno-Notivol et al., 2021). The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and psychi­ atric diseases is of great concern, with an evident link between corona virus infections and various central and peripheral nervous system manifestations (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021). Unmitigated neuro-inflammation has been noted to underlie not only the severe respiratory complications of the disease but is also present in a range of neuro-psychiatric illnesses (Brand et al., 2015). Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by immune-inflammatory states, while treatments for these disorders have distinct anti-inflammatory properties and effects (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021). With inflamma­ tion being a common contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2, as well as psychiatric disorders (Jansen van Vuren et al., 2021), S. tortuosum may be of interest as it has antidepressant as well as mild anti-inflammatory properties, without hindering an adequate immune response to acute immune challenges.
