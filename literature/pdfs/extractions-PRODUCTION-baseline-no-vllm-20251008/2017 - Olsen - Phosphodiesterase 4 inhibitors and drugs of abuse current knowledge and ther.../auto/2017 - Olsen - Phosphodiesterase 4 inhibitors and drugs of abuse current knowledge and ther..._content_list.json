These brain regions are also targets of drug-associated neuroadaptations in cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling, and these neuroadaptations are thought to underlie aspects of drug tolerance and dependence (Muschamp and Carlezon, 2013; Nestler, 2015; Wen et al., 2015). In preclinical studies, PDE4 inhibitors reduce drug intake and/or drug seeking for psychostimulants, alcohol, and opioids, suggesting that PDE4 could be a therapeutic target for several classes of substance use disorder. However, the underlying mechanisms for the anti-addictive behavioral effects of PDE4 inhibitors remain poorly understood. cAMP signaling is highly compartmentalized. PDE4 inhibitors can break down such compartmentalization and causes widespread increase in intracellular cAMP levels (Cooper, 2005). PDE4 inhibitors may disrupt or occlude cAMP-related neuroadaptations caused by drugs of abuse.

Consistent with this, PDE4B-immunopositive neurons and neuropil are observed in the nucleus accumbens (Cherry and Davis, 1999; Perez-Torres et al., 2000). Within the striatum, PDE4B is differentially expressed in two major, functionally distinct subpopulations of medium spiny neurons. Striatal medium spiny neurons are organized into a dopamine ${ \\bf D } _ { 1 }$ receptor-expressing “direct” (striatonigral) output pathway and a dopamine ${ \\bf D } _ { 2 }$ receptor-expressing “indirect” (striatopallidal) output pathway, where the direct pathway is behaviorally stimulating, whereas the indirect pathway is behaviorally suppressant (Graybiel, 1990, 2000). Using transgenic mice with different tags of dopamine ${ \\bf D } _ { 1 }$ and ${ \\bf D } _ { 2 }$ receptors, it was found that the expression of PDE4B was higher in ${ \\bf D } _ { 2 }$ receptor-enriched striatopallidal neurons than that in D1 receptor-enriched striatonigral neurons (Nishi et al., 2008).

The conditioned place preference (CPP) test is a behavioral test that measures an animal’s preference for a place that is associated with previous exposure to a reward. CPP protocols are typically divided into three phases: a pre-test, a conditioning phase,and a post-test. In the pre-test, a drug naive animal is allowed to explore the entire CPP apparatus (typically composed of two or three distinct, but connected chambers). During the conditioning phase, the animal spends time confined to each of the chambers,however one chamber is paired with a reward (e.g., cocaine), while the other chamber is not (e.g. saline). After several of these pairing sessions, the animal undergoes the post-test in which the animal again is allowed to explore the entire CPP apparatus in a drug free state. The conditioned place preference is typically measured in one of two ways: 1) the difference in time spent in the reward paired chamber between the pre-test and post-test or 2)</td></tr><tr><td>Intravenous drug self-administration (Allain et al., 2015; Muelbl et al., 2016; Olsen and Winder, 2006; Thomsen and Caine, 2005)</td><td>animal is in a drug-free state. Intravenous drug self-administration is a measure of the reinforcing properties of a drug. The basis of this test is that a positive outcome associated with a response willincrease the likelihood of the response in the future. Thus, intravenous drug self-administration is a type of operant (instrumental) conditioning that uses intravenous infusion of a drug as the reinforcer. An animal with a chronic venous catheter is placed into an operant conditioning chamber, where it learns thataresponse on the \"active\"manipulanda (e.g.,a lever) results in a drug infusion, whereas a response on the “inactive\" manipulanda has no consequence.

Reinstatement of drug seeking is a measure of drug seeking that is evoked by a stimulus. The basis of this test is that drug seeking (either using the CPP or the operant response in a drug self-administration test) is first extinguished by dissociating the connection between the drug and the drug conditioned response through repeated testing without the drug, then reinstated with a stimulus. Stimuli that are commonly used to reinstate drug seeking include drug- associated cues, stress, or a priming dose of the drug itself. These stimuli are known to also elicit craving in human drug users. The outcome measures are active and inactive manipulandum responding or time spent in the drug and nondrug paired sides (depending on if this is a self-administration or CPP test respectively).

The two bottle choice test is a measure of voluntary alcohol intake and preference.In this test,alcohol is concurrently available with water and food, so alcohol intake is driven by hedonic processes as opposed to metabolic need.

The basis of this test is that direct stimulation of some brain regions (e.g., ventral tegmental area) or specific pathways (e.g., ventral hippocampus to nucleus accumbens) is innately reinforcing. Thus, operant conditioning is performed using stimulation as the primary reinforcer. Data from intracranial self-stimulation experimentsare commonly represented as response rates across a series of stimulus intensities (orfrequencies),and treatments that enhance brain stimulation reward will produce a left-shift in this intensity-response curve.

However, aftera cocaine infusion, only presses on the left lever deliver a food pellet. Test sessions occur in the absence of food reward,and the outcome measure is the percentage of cocaine- or saline-appropriate responses after each treatment. There are two main types of drug discrimination tests: stimulus antagonism and stimulus generalization.A stimulus antagonism drug discrimination test can be used to measure the ability of a different drug to reduce the discriminative stimulus properties of the comparator drug. For example, pretreatment with flumazenil (an antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA-A receptor) reduces the percentage of diazepam-appropriate responses in rats trained to discriminate diazepam from saline.A stimulus generalization drug discrimination test assesses the ability of a drug to generalize to another comparative drug.

In the same model, the PDE4 (cAMP specific) inhibitor rolipram did not have a significant effect on the extinction of cocaine CPP (Liddie et al., 2012). These results indicate that different subtypes of PDEs regulate the acquisition vs. extinction of drug-cue associative memories. ",

Similar to the aforementioned effects on cocaine-associated hyperlocomotion, they report that ibudilast and its analog AV1013 reduce the methamphetamine-induced increase in locomotor activity and sensitization without significantly affecting locomotor activity by itself (Snider et al., 2012). In addition, ibudilast and AV1013 are effective in attenuating methamphetamine self-administration and drug seeking behavior. Systemic administration of these compounds reduces methamphetamine self-administration on an FR1 schedule in the rat (Snider et al., 2013). Systemic ibudilast and AV1013 significantly reduces footshockand prime-induced reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking in the rat (Beardsley et al., 2010). Interestingly, the reduction of drug seeking behavior by ibudilast and its analog may be associated with inflammatory processes. Methamphetamine activates glial cells and increases proinflammatory cytokine production in the brain, and glial cell activation and inflammatory responses have been linked to drug abuse-related behavior (Beardsley and Hauser, 2014).

Taken together, these studies indicate that PDE inhibitors reduce alcohol drinking in multiple rodent models, including models of genetic susceptibility and dependence. Given that ibudilast is a non-selective PDE inhibitor, this study raises the question whether inhibitors to other PDE subtypes reduce alcohol drinking and dependence. Using 24-h two-bottle choice and two-bottle choice with limited (3-h) access to alcohol in C56BL/6J male mice, a recent study has compared the effects of nine PDE inhibitors with different subtype selectivity. Interestingly, only the selective PDE4 inhibitors reduce ethanol intake and preference in the 24-h two-bottle choice test and in the limited access test (Blednov et al., 2014). More recent studies have shown that the PDE10A inhibitor TP-10 reduces alcohol self-administration in conditions predisposing to elevated self-administration. In addition, TP-10 also reduces alcohol self-administration in genetically alcohol-preferring rats, and in alcohol-non-dependent and -dependent rats (Logrip et al., 2014).

In rats treated with single morphine, naloxone challenge induces an increase in PDE4 activity on frontal cortex and hippocampus. In contrast, in rats treated repeatedly with morphine, the naloxone challenge produced no significant effects on PDE4 activity although cyclic AMP was significantly increased by naloxone challenge (Kimura et al., 2006). These results suggest that the lack of PDE4 activation leads to an increase in levels of cAMP, which may be involved in naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal symptoms (Kimura et al., 2006). Consistent with this premise, subsequent studies have shown that repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections, but not acute injections, of PDE4 inhibitors rolipram dampen naloxone-precipitated behavioral signs of morphine withdrawal, such as teeth-chattering, tremor, piloerection, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, ptosis, spontaneous jumping and wet-dog shakes, and weight loss (Gonzalez-Cuello et al., 2007; Hamdy et al., 2001; Mamiya et al., 2001; Nunez et al., 2009). The attenuation of withdrawal syndrome by the PDE4 inhibitors is likely mediated by the up-regulation of the cAMP signaling (Gonzalez-Cuello et al., 2007; Nunez et al., 2009).

Roflumilast is the only approved PDE4 inhibitor for the treatment of COPD, and it reduces COPD exacerbations and modestly improves lung function (Mulhall et al., 2015). More recently, the PDE4 inhibitor MK-0952 has been under a phase II clinical trial for cognition-enhancing effects (Wang et al., 2015). Apremilast is an orally effective PDE4 inhibitor that was approved by US FDA in 2015 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (Gisondi and Girolomoni, 2016). It is safe and well-tolerated, although it causes nausea and vomiting in some patients (Gisondi and Girolomoni, 2016). As mentioned earlier in this review, preclinical studies with animal models have shown that the non-selective PDE inhibitor ibudilast reduces drug seeking behaviors of methamphetamine (Beardsley et al., 2010; Snider et al., 2013; Snider et al., 2012) and alcohol-dependence (Bell et al., 2015). Ibudilast is currently in a Phase I clinical trial for alcohol use disorders as well as in Phase II clinical trials for methamphetamine dependence and oxycodone abuse (Logrip, 2015). Ibudilast inhibits both PDE and glial proinflammatory activity, which has been linked to its anti-addiction effects (Beardsley and Hauser, 2014). Thus, PDE inhibitors may represent a promising candidate for developing anti-addiction medications. PDE4 inhibitors have adverse side-effects such as nausea and emesis, which limit their clinical utility (O’Donnell and Zhang, 2004). Activation of PDE4D, which is highly expressed in the area postrema, an emetic-trigger zone (Lamontagne et al., 2001), is related to emetic potential of PDE4 inhibitors (Robichaud et al., 2002). Subtype- or isoform-specific PDE4 inhibitors are expected to be developed in the future to minimize their off-target effects (Wang et al., 2015). Paradoxically, non-selective, broader acting drugs such as ibudilast may retain the pharmacological efficacy of PDE inhibition with less side effects. Alternatively, targeting PDE4A or 4B, PDE isoforms with expression in mesocorticolimbic circuitry, may prove to be effective in treatment of substance drug and/or alcohol abuse without inducing the degree of nausea that non-selective PDE4 inhibitors do.

PDE4 inhibition-induced reduction of the effects of drugs of abuse may be mediated primarily by PDE4B. Selective PDE4B inhibitors may represent an effective means to reduce drug seeking behavior while avoiding emetic effects of PDE4 inhibitors that are mediated by activation of the PDE4D. Recently a series of triazine derivatives were found to be PDE4B selective inhibitors, which show $> 1 0 0$ -fold selectivity over the PDE4D isozyme. These PDE4B inhibitors exhibited potent anti-inflammatory effects invivoand showed less emesis (Hagen et al., 2014; Naganuma et al., 2009). PDE4B inhibition may also have effects on generalized anxiety, which could influence drug craving during abstinence. Knockout of a large region of the catalytic domain (exons 8–11) resulted in increased anxiety-like behavior in the several assays (Zhang et al., 2008), although there was no difference in the elevated plus maze (Siuciak et al., 2008). In contrast, reduction of cAMP hydrolization via Y358C substitution within the catalytic subregion reduced anxiety-like behavior (McGirr et al., 2016). These conflicting results make it difficult to predict how a particular PDE4B specific inhibitor may influence generalized anxiety during drug abstinence, however inhibitors with selectivity for the PDE4B are predicted to have a strong potential for alleviating drug craving without the emetic effects associated with non-selective PDE4 inhibition.
