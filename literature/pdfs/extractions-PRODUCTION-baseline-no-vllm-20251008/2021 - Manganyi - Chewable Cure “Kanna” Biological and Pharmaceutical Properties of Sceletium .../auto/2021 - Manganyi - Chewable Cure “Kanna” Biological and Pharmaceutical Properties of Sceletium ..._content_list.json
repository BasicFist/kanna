        "text": "Abstract: Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E.Br. (Mesembryanthemaceae), commonly known as kanna or kougoed, is an effective indigenous medicinal plant in South Africa, specifically to the native San and Khoikhoi tribes. Today, the plant has gained strong global attraction and reputation due to its capabilities to promote a sense of well-being by relieving stress with calming effects. Historically, the plant was used by native San hunter-gatherers and Khoi people to quench their thirst, fight fatigue and for healing, social, and spiritual purposes. Various studies have revealed that extracts of the plant have numerous biological properties and isolated alkaloids of Sceletium tortuosum are currently being used as dietary supplements for medicinal purposes and food. Furthermore, current research has focused on the commercialization of the plant because of its treatment in clinical anxiety and depression, psychological and psychiatric disorders, improving mood, promoting relaxation and happiness. In addition, several studies have focused on the isolation and characterization of various beneficial bioactive compounds including alkaloids from the Sceletium tortuosum plant. Sceletium was reviewed more than a decade ago and new evidence has been published since 2008, substantiating an update on this South African botanical asset. Thus, this review provides an extensive overview of the biological and pharmaceutical properties of Sceletium tortuosum as well as the bioactive compounds with an emphasis on antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and other significant biological effects. There is a need to critically evaluate the bioactivities and responsible bioactive compounds, which might assist in reinforcing and confirming the significant role of kanna in the promotion of healthy well-being in these stressful times.

For example, an ethanolic extract of S. tortuosum with purified alkaloids mesembrine, mesembrenol, and mesembrenone showed inhibitory effects on serotonin (5HT) reuptake and phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) activity [9]. S. tortuosum is a succulent, flowering plant casually known as kougoed or kanna, indigenous to South Africa [9]. The plant is a member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family [10]. In addition, Sceletium is well-known as “Kanna, Channa, and Kougoed”, meaning something to chew or is chewable.

Furthermore, the dicotyledonous flowering part of the plant comprises whitish to pale yellow, sometimes, pale pink petals supported by pedicellate (Figure 2b). The calyx contains four or five sepals. Imbricate leaves with incurved tips represent a very distinct characteristic, keeping in mind that in its hygrochastic state, the fruit opens up. The Sceletium genera belongs to the family Aizoaceae and subfamily Mesembryanthemoideae, recognized in 1925 by N.E. Brown.

Its geographical distribution is from the Namaqualand arid region of Namibia to Montagu in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, near the Western Little Karoo through to Aberdeen of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Sceletium genera are succulent plants that flourish in sandy loam soil in predominantly dry environments under shrubs in partial shade. In the dry season, the leaves dry out, enclosing young leaves to protect them against unfavorable environmental conditions. In addition, they propagate extremely well in rockeries and pots [18,19].

Depression can result in suicide, if not treated. Suicide was reported to be the second leading cause of fatalities in people aged 15–29 years. Moreover, approximately 800,000 individuals commit suicide per annum. Currently, therapeutic procedures for treating depression include psychological and pharmacological treatments for moderate and severe depression. In addition, $7 6 \\%$ and $8 5 \\%$ of patients in low and middle-income countries are not receiving treatments for mental disorders, respectively [51]. In response, traditional historic and anecdotal records show the effectiveness of medicinal plants where the plants were used for pharmacological treatment of mental health problems and disorders, particularly depression [52,53].

It has been found that compounds such as mesembrine, mesembrenol, and mesembranone are the key players. They have potent 5-HT as described by U.S. Pat. No. 6288104, which has an uptake inhibitory activity. Furthermore, it has been very active on mental health patients (mild to moderate depression). The compound has been stated in the past to be a frail PDE4 inhibitor [55]. Pervez and colleagues [56] conducted an in-depth study on plant alkaloids as an alternative treatment for depression in the last decade. The researchers established that S. tortuosum has an abundance of various alkaloids used in clinically depressed people [56,57]. ",

In addition, the use and administration of traditional herbal medicines will assist individuals. S. tortuosum has been reported to treat depression, stress, and anxiety during these difficult times [58]. A study was conducted on the mesembrine of S. tortuosum, used as a substitute treatment for depression. Succulent S. tortuosum was obtained from the Cape region of South Africa. The results showed that Sceletium extracts have various alkaloids mesembrines, which have a calming effect and anxiolytic properties. The alkaloid family provides either serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) or phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors. In an animal model, a low concentration of $( 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g } )$ and a high dose $( 8 0 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g } )$ of S. tortuosum extracts were administered to BALB/c mice. Data further showed that pharmacological analyses displayed mesembrine alkaloids in S. tortuosum and possessed anti-depressant activity [59]. Many studies have revealed S. tortuosum as an anti-depressant agent. These properties have been articulated in research papers using different models such as in vitro studies, animal models [59] as well as human studies. The fact that this plant is used as a stress reliever, mood elevator, and is a sedative means that it is an ideal anti-depressant candidate [54]. ",

Sharma and co-workers [60] identified S. tortuosum as one of the most potent medicinal plants used globally for the treatment of anxiety-associated conditions and anxiety. Pharmacological and clinical investigations revealed that medicinal plants including S. tortuosum exhibit anxiolytic properties [60].

Moreover, S. tortuosum displayed an anti-anxiety effect in zebrafish larvae. This is part of a full in vivo endorsement of the traditional use of the plant [61]. In current research, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and δ-opioid receptor are the key players in depression and anxiety conditions [62–64]. Several studies have shown mesembrine isolated from S. tortuosum plants. The plant had agonist actions on GABAA, $\\mu { }$ -opioid, δ2-opioid, cholecystokinin-1, and melatonin-1 E4-prostaglandin receptors. This might be responsible for the anti-anxiolytic properties in vivo animal models [65–67]. A recent clinical study was conducted using plant extracts of S. tortuosum (trademarked—Zembrin®, Morristown, NJ, USA) to determine the anti-anxiolytic potential of the plant. The study was placebo-controlled, double-blind whereby 20 young healthy volunteers were administrated a single dose of S. tortuosum $( 2 5 \\mathrm { m g } , Z \\mathrm { e m b r i n } ^ { \\textregistered } .$ ).

Fountain [69] conducted a preclinical model assay on chicks to determine the effectiveness against anxiety and depression of S. tortuosum plant extracts.

S. tortuosum extracts (10, 20, 30, 50, 75, or $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g ) }$ were administrated to the chicks prior to stress. The results suggest that initially, the chicks had high DVoc levels, showing an anxiety characteristic. The results also revealed that S. tortuosum extracts displayed significant anti-depression activities [69]. Sceletium plants have been reported to have calming effects and improve mood. The phytochemical profile of S. tortuosum has been isolated and has identified psychoactive compounds.

Despite the extensive documented history of the psychological and biological effect, few studies have proved that the Sceletium plant possesses useful analgesic properties [10,28,66,70]. The effects of S. tortuosum were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The results revealed that mesembrine, as a major compound in S. tortuosum, can be responsible for analgesic activity [66].
