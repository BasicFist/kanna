My findings suggest this partiality has obscured the wider healing context in which the dance operates.Exploring the wider context,including massage,‘medicinal cuts',and witchcraft,reveals thatthe‘potency'conceived as central to the healing dance is,in certain contexts,equivalent to overlapping ideas of wind,arrows,and smel. Examination of the ethnography reveals that a number of the associations 丨 make between wind and potency have been partially recognized in specific Khoisan contexts but,because comparative studies of Khoisan are dificult and unpopular, these similarities have gone largely unnoticed.

It also tells animals where Khoisan are.The direction of wind must be known if a hunter is to avoid alerting his prey to his presence.Wind connects the hunter with the prey like a thread leading from one body to another. The relationship is a deeper one founded in a wider co-evolution.Wind or smells and pheromones draw and repulse organisms to their mutual ends.When the wind of an animal or plant enters a Khoisan body there is a unity between the two phenomena.Wind smells lock participants into a web of relationships.The essence of one organism connects with another.

The scent marker binds the one who encounters them into a powerful relationship of consequence,in a similar bind as that existing between the tracker, the track,and the animal.Potency is both a bound quality of the potential consequences of connection and the formal essence that lies behind that connection. Khoisan use certain animal remedies,particularly from strong-'smelling' animals or animals,which bring significant consequences,because their strong smell carries the essence,wind,or potency of the animal.A person with the medicine becomes potentized and takes on the wind of the source,thus both absorbing the power of the source and serving as a means of protection against it.

Winds of healers,animals,strangers,and people in dangerous or liminal states can also cause harm.There is wind that enters people with food,particularly fizzy drinks.At the same time,winds are known by their effects,which give them a form or identity- a rainwind or a hot person-killing wind. Ingold observed that in aboriginal cultures causality is personal, not mechanical or biological,and wind is thought of as being like a person (2ooo: 48).To the Khoisan, wind is like a person or an animal,and as such can be talked to and negotiated with.But regardless of the differences between these various winds, they all have the potential to enter people.

This latter way of wearing the skin is termed //hobe amongst the Damara and Nama. One Nharo Bushman suggested they used eland skin in a similar manner for similar reasons.That one‘strong' child could make another ill whilst playing with them was attributed to the wind of the kudu or eland being too strong for the unprotected child.

He observed that Bushmen believed the poison would 'smell' the warmth and gather around the heated area.The poison could then be released from the body by cutting at the heated area where the poison had accumulated (Lebzelter 1934: 47).Ju/'hoansi Kunta Bo,like other Khoisan healers,knows who is sick around the healing fire because he smells them.

The nuances of the procedure vary amongst different groups.Damara rainmen whom I encountered sucked up a sickness and snorted it out into a fire,where it was destroyed. These healers danced to waken the rain- or windspirit within them.If it became too strong for one healer,he or she might collapse or release the build-up by blowing the windspirit into the ears of another healer. Bushmen healers similarly sucked out illness with their mouths.Dorothea Bleek recorded that Bushmen healers, t/o k?au, from central Angola extracted evil by smelling and snoring (1928: 124).In the 1770s Gordon reported that he encountered a Bushman snorting out an evil spirit or devil from her son that looked like a cobra (1988:216).The /Xam healers ‘snored' sick people with their noses and claimed to snore out illness-causing entities,including miniature lions,butterflies,and sticks (D.F. Bleek 1935: 3,5). Often this was accompanied by a bleeding nose.In these episodes of moving sickness, the disease-causing entity is conceptually given the insubstantial quality of wind, which can settle,become dormant, move,and be moved.

This perspective,which seems pertinent to the thinking of Khoisan broadly, operates alongside an education of awareness that has historically alerted Khoisan to what is special and meaningful in different forms of organic and inorganic life that they encounter.There is a link between the sort of idea proposed by Lévy-Bruhl concerning animal forms dictating their identity and power and Khoisan ideas of potency, wind, and smell.A phenomenon is known for what is special about it,and that speciality,be it‘windness'or‘lionness',and so on,is held in both secretions and excretions of an organism or the effect it can have on the world around it.The power of the phenomenon to influence the world around it is conceived as potency.In Khoisan idiom,active potency is conceived as being'awoken' and standing, as opposed to dormant and lying.
