Mesembrenone and mesembrine are the two main pharmacologically active alkaloids present in the extract. Despite the wide therapeutic applications of Sceletium extract, there are no reports of in vivo pharmacokinetic properties or analytical methods to quantify these two important alkaloids in plasma. Therefore, the current study aimed to develop and validate a simple and sensitive analytical method for simultaneous quantification of mesembrenone and mesembrine in mouse plasma. Ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QToF‐MS) was employed to achieve our objectives. The compounds were extracted using protein precipitation by methanol $( 1 0 0 \\% )$ with quinine as an internal standard. The lower limit of quantification for both the compounds was $1 0 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ . The extraction recovery was between 87 and $93 \\%$ for both compounds with no matrix effects on the analysis. The accuracy was between 89.5 and $106 \\%$ and precision was $< 1 2 . 6 \\%$ for all quality control samples. This validated method was successfully applied to evaluate the i.v. plasma pharmacokinetics of mesembrine and mesembrenone in mouse. However, the oral bioavailability of these alkaloids was poor and the plasma levels were below the detection limits. ",

        "text": "Sceletium tortuosum, belonging to the family Mesembryanthemaceae, is an indigenous South African herb. It is commonly named Kanna or Channa (Smith, 2011). Traditionally, the plant is consumed by smoking or chewing dried leaves or in the form of a tincture, and it is widely used in the treatment of central nervous system‐related disorders such as anxiety, depression, and stress (Smith et al., 1996). Sceletium extract is widely used throughout the world as an herbal supplement in the treatment of anxiety and stress. A recent clinical study with the plant extract (Zembrin) showed that it has a very good anxiolytic potential in humans. The authors concluded that the therapeutic properties of the extract may be attributed to its combined inhibition of 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) receptor and Phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) enzyme (Terburg et al., 2013). There are several alkaloids present in Kanna, however, the two main pharmacologically active alkaloids being reported to be mesembrenone and mesembrine (Harvey et al., 2011). Mesembrine, the major alkaloid in Kanna, is a potent 5‐HT inhibitor. Additionally, it has been shown to effectively inhibit PDE4 (Gericke & Viljoen, 2008). Mesembrine is a bicyclic molecule with two bridge‐ head chiral carbons between the five‐membered ring and the six‐membered ring (Figure 1). Mesembrenone is structurally similar to mesembrine except for the presence of a double bond on C4 and C5 ( Figure 1). Mesembrenone has been shown to have a cytotoxic effect in cancer cells (Weniger et al., 1995), in addition to its anti‐5HT and PDE4 inhibition properties. Mesembrine is a more potent 5‐HT inhibitor while mesembrenone is more potent towards PDE4. These differences were attributed to the structural differences between the two molecules (Harvey et al., 2011). In addition, reports have indicated that these alkaloids may have potential in other inflammatory diseases like ",

In this study we have developed a validated method for quantification of mesembrine and mesembrenone in mouse plasma using UHPLC/QToF‐MS. This validated method was subsequently applied to a pharmacokinetic study in mice. The chemical structures of mesembrine and mesembrenone are shown in Figure 1.

The concentrations of both compounds were quantified by determining the peak area ratio with IS. The calibration equation for mesembrenone determined from the standard curve was $y = 0 . 1 4 8 4 x + 5 . 4$ with a correlation coefficient $( R ^ { 2 } )$ of 0.999, while the equation of mesembrine was $y = 0 . 1 5 4 5 x + 1 . 7$ with an $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.998, showing a good linearity for both compounds. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of both compounds was determined to be $1 0 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ while the lower limit of detection (LLOD) was $5 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , demonstrating a high sensitivity of the detection of mesembrenone and mesembrine in plasma samples. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined by injecting a series of diluted solutions with known concentrations for each standard.

In contrast, extraction efficiency with MeOH was $58 5 \\%$ with all the QC samples at 10, 250 and $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { n g / m L }$ , as shown in Table 2. This data indicates that MeOH is a better solvent for the extraction of mesembrenone and mesembrine from plasma. In addition, this simple one‐step procedure is ideal for the extraction of a large set of samples in a shorter time period. The presence of endogenous compounds in a matrix may interfere with the ionization and separation of compounds (Van Eeckhaut et al., 2009). Accordingly, the effects of components present in the mouse plasma on the ionization and separation of mesembrenone and mesembrine were evaluated. The peak areas of mesembrenone and mesembrine in post‐extracted blank plasma were not significantly different $( 9 5 - 9 9 \\% )$ from the corresponding methanol samples, as shown in Table 2.

The pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated from the concentration–time profile (Figure 3) of both compounds using Phoenix‐WinNonlin software (Pharsight, CA, USA). The elimination half‐life $( T _ { 1 / 2 } )$ of mesembrenone and mesembrine was $0 . 7 9 \\pm 0 . 1 1$ and $0 . 6 0 \\pm 0 . 0 5 \\mathsf { h }$ , respectively, with corresponding clearance (CL) values of $4 7 \\pm 6$ and $7 2 \\pm 1 4 \\lfloor / \\mathrm { h / k g }$ .

The representative chromatograms of plasma collected from mice at various time intervals after i.v. administration of mesembrenone and mesembrine are shown in Figure 4. It was interesting to note that, after oral administration of the enriched S. tourtuosum extract, both mesembrine and mesembrenone $( 7 5 \\mathrm { m g / k g ) }$ were not detected in plasma (data not shown). This data suggests that these alkaloids have very low oral bioavailability. A recent study has shown that mesembrine and mesembrenone are metabolically unstable in human liver microsomes (Meyer et al., 2015). Additional factors such as instability in gastric and intestinal fluids may further contribute to observed low bioavailability of mesembrine and mesembrenone observed in this study. ",

The calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients ${ > } 0 . 9 9$ . Using the validated method, the i.v. pharmacokinetics of mesembrine and mesembrenone were evaluated. However, the plasma concentrations of two alkaloids after an oral dose were not detectable, indicating a low oral bioavailability.
