Hartwich and Zwicky (1914) conclude their scientific communication on Sceletium expansum and Sceletium tortuosum by stating that the indigenous people undoubtedly used the plant more for enjoyment than as a medicine.

A proprietary selected standardized extract has been commercialized under the name of Zembrin®. Sceletium has been used as a simple masticatory, for the relief of thirst and hunger, to combat fatigue, as medicines, and for social and spiritual purposes by San huntergatherers (historically referred to as Bushmen) and Khoi pastoralists (historically referred to as Hottentots) for millennia before the earliest written reports of the uses of these plants by European explorers and settlers (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). In 2009, the South African company HG&H Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd. was granted the country's first integrated export and bioprospecting permit, allowing it to research, develop and export the first standardized extract of Sceletium tortuosum under the trade mark Zembrin® (Patnala and Kanfer, 2009), whereby royalties from sales of Zembrin® are paid to the South African San Council. Zembrin® has been tested clinically after acute and repetitive intake using a combination of psychometry and quantitative EEG. Zembrin® induced a positive effect on the electrical activity of the brain during cognitive processing after intake of a single dosage of $5 0 \\mathrm { m g }$ . In addition, alpha1 and alpha2 spectral power in the frontal brain was increased during several challenges including brain teasing, arithmetic calculations and performance of a memory test. Increases of spectral alpha1 power indicate a greater degree of calmness and may represent decreased depressive symptoms, while increases in alpha2 waves have been related to memory (Dimpfel et al., 2016a, 2016b). These results were reproduced after repetitive dosing. After six weeks also a reduction of the anxiety questionnaire was documented. Discriminant analysis revealed a projection of Zembrin® data into the vicinity of another calming preparation and a Ginkgo-Ginseng mixture (Dimpfel et al., 2017). Following this clinical characterization we went to active ingredients according to “reverse pharmacology”. ",

        "text": "The current experimental series revealed a new physiological effect of Zembrin® on the electric activity of the hippocampus. The excitability of the intra-hippocampal electric circuit between the Schaffer collaterals and the pyramidal cells was attenuated in a dose dependent manner by repetitive gavage administration of Zembrin®. Single doses of 5 and $1 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ orally have been found to significantly reduce spectral power in four brain regions of freely moving rats (Dimpfel et al., 2016a). With respect to dosage our experience is that we have to administer 5 - maximum 10 times higher dosages in rats in comparison to humans on a kg-base (see also Shannon et al., 2007). That means that $5 \\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { k g }$ in rats correspond to $0 . 5 { - } 1 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ in humans. It corresponds well to the $5 0 \\mathrm { m g }$ , which we have administered in our clinical studies. These doses of 5 and $1 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ of Zembrin® - now administered repetitively daily during one week in rats - obviously down-regulated the excitability of the intra-hippocampal neurotransmission. Since Schaffer Collaterals (location of the electric stimulation) and pyramidal cells (location of recording) are connected by synapses using glutamate as transmitter, we interrogated which of the different glutamate receptors might be involved. Therefore, the effect of Zembrin was challenged using 4 specific agonists given in vitro. Only the two ionotrophic receptor mediated transmissions seemed to be involved. Mainly AMPA receptor mediated transmission was attenuated, but clearly less NMDA receptor mediated transmission was also recognized to be responsible for the attenuation of the population spike amplitudes induced by repetitive Zembrin® administration. Glutamatergic AMPA receptor mediated neurotransmission has been known for a long time (for review see Seeburg, 1993) and long term potentiation (LTP) as the result of theta burst stimulation has been shown to be based mainly on AMPA receptor mediated processes in the hippocampus (Dozmorov et al., 2006). Therefore, the reduction of the LTP induced in vivo by repetitive administration of Zembrin® indicates a strong physiological relevance with respect to AMPA receptor mediated transmission. ",

Spectral analysis of local field potentials revealed main effects on alpha2 and beta1 frequencies especially in cortical and hippocampal areas (Dimpfel et al., 2016a). Since beta1 waves are under the control of glutamatergic transmission (Dimpfel, 2015) the present results confirm an interference of the action of Zembrin® with this transmitter activity. This points to a new mechanism of action in addition to the two described in an earlier paper, namely inhibition of reuptake of serotonin, and inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) (Harvey et al., 2011). Whereas the action of Zembrin® on the glutamatergic system might be related more to a physiological calming and neuroprotective action leading to better coping with stress, inhibition of serotonin reuptake might point more to a possible anti-depressive effect. Clinical results after intake of Zembrin® indicate a significant calming action and – after repetitive intake of 6 weeks duration– also an anti-anxiety effect (Dimpfel et al., 2016b, 2017). ",

Following the goal of “reverse pharmacology” isolated single ingredients should be tested in the same model and compared to the effects of the whole extract. Four pure $( \\sim 9 8 \\% )$ chemically characterized alkaloids were available to us to be tested in vitro directly on the amplitude of the population spike in the presence of single shock stimulation as well as during theta burst stimulation. All four alkaloids were able to attenuate the amplitude of the population spike under both stimulation conditions in a concentration dependent manner similar to the effect as observed for the whole extract (Zembrin®). Meanwhile it has been shown that all four alkaloids change the frequency pattern of rat field potentials at a very low dosage of $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { g / k g }$ given orally and by it proofed to be able to cross the blood brain barrier (Dimpfel et al., to be published). Mesembrine, Mesembrenone, Mesembrenol and Mesembranol must therefore be all considered to contribute to the action of Zembrin® to a significant degree and are suitable to be used for standardization of alkaloid content and composition during the production of Sceletium extracts.

Within a final series of these experiments each of the four alkaloids was tested to see which would prevent the action of the AMPA agonist Fluorowillardine. Interestingly, only Mesembrenol and Mesembranol were able to prevent the action of Fluorowillardine as observed for the total extract. Therefore, these two ingredients - being effective in the nanomolar range - must be regarded as the main compounds responsible for the physiological calming action of Zembrin®. Presently, it is unclear why Mesembrenone in the presence of Fluorowillardine induces a statistically significant increase of the population spike during single shock stimulation. It might well be, that the active components remain attached to the relevant receptors during the perfusion period. ",

Since attenuation of AMPA mediated transmission has been related to successful adjunctive treatment of epileptic patients (Steinhoff, 2015), Mesembrenol and Mesembranol may serve as new chemical leads for the development of new drugs for the treatment of epilepsy.

There is evidence that the subunit GluR2 of the AMPA receptor interacts with the glycosphingolipid ganglioside GM1. Gm1 ganglioside prevents seizures (Fighera et al., 2006). Gangliosides sequester GluR2-containing AMPA receptors and GluR2 receptor-trafficing complexes in a reversible ATPase-dependent manner that may regulate GluR2-containing AMPAR endocytosis, AMPAR ion channel permeability, synaptic plasticity. Learning and memory. (Prendergast et al., 2014). Attenuation of AMPA receptor mediated communication within the hippocampus might therefore lead to antiepileptic activity.
