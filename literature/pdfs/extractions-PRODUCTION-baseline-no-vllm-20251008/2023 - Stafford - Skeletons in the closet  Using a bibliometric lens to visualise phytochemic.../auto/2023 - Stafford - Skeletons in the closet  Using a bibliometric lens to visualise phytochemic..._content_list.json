        "text": "Plants from the Sceletium genus (Aizoaceae) have been traditionally used by the Khoe-Sān people in southern Africa, mainly for thirst and hunger relief, pain reduction and spiritual purposes, particularly Sceletium tortuosum. The research on this species has seen rapid growth with advancements in analytical and pharmacological tools. The Web of Science (WoS) database was searched for articles related to ‘Sceletium’ and ‘Mesembrine’. These data were additionally analysed by bibliometric software (VOSviewer) to generate term maps and author associations. The thematic areas with the most citations were, South African Traditional Medicine for mental health (110) and anxiolytic agents (75). Pioneer studies in the genus focused on chemical structural isolation, purification and characterization and techniques such as thin layer chromatography, liquid chromatography (HPLC, UPLC and more recently, LC-MS), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study mesembrine alkaloids. Different laboratories have used a diverse range of extraction and pre-analytical methods that become routinely favoured in the analysis of the main metabolites (mesembrine, mesembranol, mesembranone and Sceletium A4) in their respective experimental settings. In contrast with previous reviews, this paper identified gaps in the research field, being a lack of toxicology assays, a deficit of clinical assessments, too few bioavailability studies and little to no investigation into the minor alkaloid groups found in Sceletium. Future studies are likely to see innovations in analytical techniques like leaf spray mass spectrometry and direct analysis in real-time ionization coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-HR-TOF-MS) for rapid alkaloid identification and quality control purposes. While S. tortuosum has been the primary focus, studying other Sceletium species may aid in establishing chemotaxonomic relationships and addressing challenges with species misidentification. This research can benefit the nutraceutical industry and conservation efforts for the entire genus. At present, little to no pharmacological information is available in terms of the molecular physiological effects of mesembrine alkaloids in medical clinical settings. Research in these fields is expected to increase due to the growing interest in S. tortuosum as a herbal supplement and the potential development of mesembrine alkaloids into pharmaceutical drugs. ",

The most popular and well-known taxa from the Sceletium genus (Family: Aizoaceae, subfamily: Mesembryanthemoideae) is Sceletium tortuosum. S. tortuosum is also referred to as kanna, channa, kougoed or ‘sceletium’ (Smith et al., 1998). This species is a climbing or creeping perennial with succulent leaves and stems that become thick and slightly woody with age (Klak et al., 2007). Species are distinguished based on morphology. An important diagnostic feature of this genus is the skeletonised veins that are apparent when leaves dry (Fig. 1a). The typical growth form exhibits a scandent nature (Fig. 1b and c) together with leaves that have idioblasts or “bladder cells” (Fig. 1d). The flower colour of petals ranges from white, yellow to pale pink (Fig. 1e). The seeds of Sceletium species are brown to black kidneyshaped and these are small in diameter ranging from $1 { - } 2 \\mathrm { m m }$ . (Fig. 1f). ",

        "text": "The plant is indigenous to southern Africa where it has been traditionally used in folk medicine by the Khoekhoen and Sān (Khoe-Sān/KhoiSan) people as a masticatory agent or as a mood elevator (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). More recently, S. tortuosum has been commercialised as an anti-depressant or anxiolytic and it is also recommended for attention deficit disorders, as it aids in mental alertness (Harvey et al., 2011). The chemical constituents which were recognized for their medicinal activity are a group of mesembrine alkaloids that are uniquely associated with Sceletium taxa, however, they do share some similarities with Amaryllidaceae alkaloids. There has been a particular emphasis on mesembrine (Fig. 2a), mesembrenone (Fig. 2b) and $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone (Fig. 2c) as biomarker compounds due to more scientific information being available in terms of chemical characterization.  As a result, many producers of various phytopharmaceuticals, derived from S. tortuosum in particular, utilise these compounds in their quality assurance profiling regimes as part of the production value chain linked to this species. The industry based on this particular species is ever growing as more scientific information validating the central nervous system (CNS) effects of the plant populates the primary literature. Thus far, there have been several comprehensive reviews based on the chemistry of alkaloids found in Sceletium (Jeffs et al., 1982; Lewis, 1995, 2001; Jin, 2016; Jin and Yao, 2019). Although this list may not necessarily be comprehensive as it is based on a Scopus database search, other reviews that focus on Sceletium and its phytochemistry and pharmacology include the work of  Gericke and Viljoen, (2008); Stafford et al. (2008); Van Wyk, (2011, 2015); Krstenansky, (2017); Makolo et al. (2019); Faro et al. (2020). These reviews discuss 1) the ethnobotanical history and chemical diversity in the genus (Smith et al., 1998); 2) the pharmacological and chemical evidence of ethnobotanical use in Sceletium (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008); 3) plants from South Africa with CNS-effects used for mental health purposes (Stafford et al., 2008); 4) the commercial potential of medicinal plants in South Africa (Van Wyk, 2011, 2015); 5) the occurrence, chemistry and pharmacology of mesembrine alkaloids (Krstenansky, 2017); 6) the distribution, structural elucidation, biosynthesis, organic synthesis, chemotaxonomy and biological activities of (-)-mesembrine from Sceletium species (Makolo et al., 2019); and, 7) the biomedical activities of new psychoactive substances from natural origins (Faro et al., 2020). Within this current paper, we provide an update on analytical techniques used to study Sceletium tortuosum and its relatives, where possible. We also summarise studies that focus on chemical variation as much quantitative and qualitative information is still presently missing with regards to the biochemical components that make up the phytochemical profiles of these plants. This paper also presents findings on the use of VOSviewer to identify gaps and trends in Sceletium research, which may be of value for other scientists and industry to decide on areas to research within the available options. Furthermore, there is great interest in the use of Sceletium species and Sceletium alkaloids against anxiety (Shikanga et al., 2011; Loria et al., 2014a) and depression (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008; Krstenansky, 2017) but preclinical and clinical evidence that validate these particular applications, that are grounded in an ethnobotanical context, are still limited. In spite of this, this has led to the commercialisation of $S$ . tortuosum for various phyto-pharmaceutic markets (Patnala and Kanfer, 2013; Krstenansky, 2017). ",

Currently, there is a great deal of chemical and pharmaceutical studies on Sceletium but aspects linked to the taxonomy and geographical occurrence of many species of Sceletium apart from S. tortuosum are limited. This is of relevance as species misidentifications and biodiversity losses may prevail. The first part of this review thus aimed to collate information linked to the taxonomy and distribution of Sceletium species. These data were collected from databases such as SANBI-BODATSA and iNaturalist as an introduction before an update on the pharmacology and chemistry observed within the genus is presented. It is imperative to prioritize the correct collection of species and as such an understanding of the taxonomy of the genus should be consulted. The current trends within the literature and associated authors on a global scale. The present review summarises the studies conducted on the Sceletium genus and its chemical constituents over time in terms of the progress in phytochemistry, ethnobotanical use and pharmacology. This work intends to expose the current gaps within Sceletium research. Here, we report on studies from 1961 to the present and direct attention to recent advancements and future directions that may further develop quality, safety, and toxicological standards for therapeutic and nutraceutical applications concerning S. tortuosum and its relatives.

Several species were reduced to being combined into the same species including S. joubertii L. Bol. And S. namaquense L. Bol., now considered to be part of the S. tortuosum complex. Taxonomically the plant genus was established in 1925 by N.E. Brown. However, it should be noted that Klak et al. (2007), in their phylogenetic study of the family, proposed that Mesembryanthemoideae should consist of the single genus Mesembryanthemum.

At this time, it was reported that the land was inhabited by the Attaqua Khoikhoi (Khoekhoen), who called the land ‘Cannaland’ (Gordon, 1996).  Several authors reported on the use of Sceletium tortuosum and Sceletium expansum by the indigenous people of South Africa. Some reported that the plants were used as tinctures (Pappe, 1868), occasionally snuffed or smoked, as teas (Jacobson, 1960; Smith et al., 1996; Van Wyk and Wink, 2018), or just purely as a form of recreation more than a medicine (Hartwich and Zwicky, 1914).  Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962) indicated that in Namaqualand both the aerial and the underground (root) parts were used to make kougoed and how Sceletium tortuosum was used as an agent to help with pain, hunger relief, cholic and restlessness in infants by the Nama people (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Since the review paper of Smith et al. (1998), an increasing body of scientific information, associated in particular with Sceletium tortuosum, has emerged.  However, scientific interest in this species is leading to continuous progress in the areas of phytochemistry and pharmacology.  This review aimed to provide visual networks linked to past research and identified current trends. We provide a historical account of the use of analytical techniques and pharmacological bioassays that have been employed to study S. tortuosum and its relatives. Finally, gaps in knowledge, recommendation and best practice in studying these neurologically acting medicinal plants is presented. ",

These authors were selected on the basis of contributing 4 or more publications from 1956 to 2023. Among the authors, 3 networks can be observed. The network from South Africa is the greatest contributor in terms of publications, with the leading author contributing 15 papers on the topic. This may be due to their location which allows ease-of-access to wild-growing plant materials and established working laboratory methods, where plant material is sourced through permits for collection that is not destructive. The network from Egypt contributed 13 documents on the topic. Presently, within South Africa, the Tshwane University of Technology (averaging 11 citations per year) and Stellenbosch University (averaging on 10 citations per year) are the major contributors to research and have contributed the most publications with 18 and 10 publications respectively.

Post-2000, the focus shifted to more chemical assays in an effort to develop quality control tools for the medicinally important plant, S. tortuosum, that was gaining pharmacological traction in literature as a phytomedicine used for anxiety, depression and as a mental stimulant. VOSviewer maps and an analysis of the literature indicates that the field may be shifting towards a greater focus on the toxicological and pharmacodynamics aspects of these plants (Fig. 5C). Gaps in the field of pharmacology in the field were identified as clinical trials and bioavailability studies. ",

All three are associated in a network, and as such, have exchanged techniques and gained access to analytical tools for more advanced chemical and pharmacological analysis. South Africa is suspected to be the greatest contributor to current research efforts and this may be due to South African researchers having easier access to plant materials that grow in remote locations in the country and their compliance with Biodiversity laws that govern the issue of collection permits and bioprospecting activities linked to indigenous and endemic plant species in the country. Outside of this collaboration network, India has contributed 14 documents without collaboration with South Africa and these documents mainly cover topics related to the synthesis of mesembrine and joubertiamine alkaloids from Sceletium and one paper on the quality control of medicinal plants (Kumar and Sharma, 2018).

This is seen as the most dominant cluster in terms of publications, indicated by a red cluster. The most commonly used mesembrine alkaloid biomarkers in quality control and analysis are mesembrine (Fig. 2a), mesembrenone (Fig 2b), mesembranol (Fig 6, compound 2) and mesembrenol (Fig 6, compound 3). Some alkaloid classes which have been under-represented in the literature that may hold medicinal activity but have not been tested yet are joubertiamine (Fig 6, compound 5), sceletium alkaloid ${ \\bf A } _ { 4 }$ (Fig 6, compound 6) and the tortuosamine alkaloid classes of compounds (Fig 6, compound 8), that are also found in Sceletium species. The purple cluster represents experimentation related to the isolation and identification of compounds by various analytical means (Fig. 5c). The body of work is quite substantial and has had a wide range of analytical techniques applied to the phytochemical characterisation of Sceletium species and related commercial products (Table 1). The main analytical techniques that seem to be predominantly applied include Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer (UPLC-MS), High Performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer (HPLC-MS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).

        "text": "Analytical chemistry in Sceletium has been of scientific interest since the 1970s. Many of the studies in the 1970s were mainly focused on compound isolation and structural elucidation (Jeffs et al., 1970, 1974b, 1974a; Arndt and Kruger, 1971; Abou-Donia et al., 1978; Nieuwenhuis et al., 1981), as examples). For these purposes, large amounts of material are needed to obtain metabolites in plants that generally occur in small quantities. This may largely have been driven by the search for novel phytochemicals that would be of interest for pharmaceutical companies, at that particular time. In terms of Sceletium, however, the isolated structures did not necessarily enter into a drug discovery pipeline during the period of 1970 to 1998. The analysis of crude extracts using a variety of techniques, from thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography is more evident in the literature and various laboratories have published several papers that focus on analyzing mesembrine alkaloids. With changes in research foci in the natural products industry, where the study of complex plant mixtures using metabolomics in the 2000s till present has become an established field, smaller quantities of plant materials are being utilised. Secondly, the focus has shifted to using such strategies for quality assessment of wild-harvested Sceletium species, as a means to compare wild populations to define chemotypes that occur naturally. Also, such application of metabolomics is explored for its potential contribution to the development of quality assurance protocols to ensure that Sceletium-based products are scientifically verified to contain the biomarker mesembrine alkaloids, that define their biochemical makeup (Masondo and Makunga, 2019). In a chronological format, the different analytical methods that have been used in Sceletium phytochemical studies are discussed below. ",

The extraction of alkaloids was achieved by acid-base extraction, yielding $ { \\mathbf { 4 . 0 2 g } }$ of crude alkaloids ( $2 . 6 \\%$ of dried weight). Gas-liquid partition chromatography (GLPC) was used for the determination of mesembrine type alkaloids in the crude extract. Two columns were used in this analysis, namely, SE-30 and Carbowax 20M.

Misidentification of plant material can also occur and not all the species have the same profile of mesembrine alkaloids. It is thus important to report on the provenance of plant material and some of the early works with this particular plant did not necessarily take this into great consideration. ",

        "text": "There is a clear lack of analytical isolation methods being used in studying the chemical constituents of S. tortuosum and its relatives from the 1980s till 1998. Renewed interest in these species is evident thereafter, with the work of Smith et al. (1998) that tested 21 species from 9 genera of the Mesembryanthemaceae, for the distribution of mesembrine alkaloids. As compared with previous studies, significantly less plant material was used per extraction with methods staying relatively the same. The analytical techniques had advanced quite notably with the last research on Sceletium and its alkaloids that had been performed 16 years prior. Many investigations after 1998, use smaller amounts of the plant sample as techniques that are in routine use for metabolite profiling are much more robust. Alkaloids were extracted from root, stem and leaf tissues using $2 5 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ each of each plant part and a total of $7 5 \\mathrm { g }$ of being material thus being used. A soxhlet extraction with $9 5 \\%$ ethanol for $1 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ was performed. This extraction was followed by separation in a column packed with $6 0 ~ \\mathrm { m l }$ Extrelut (a specially processed, inert, wide pore Kieselguhr with a high pore volume). The solvent system used in the column was $4 0 ~ \\mathrm { m l }$ dichloromethane: isopropanol (85:15; v/v). The solvent was removed and samples were run using column chromatography again with the following solvents: dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, methanol and acetic acid. These fractions were run on TLC plates before Dragendorff’s reagent was sprayed on the plates to confirm the presence of alkaloids. The studied fractions were concentrated and analysed using gas chromatography (GC) fitted with a nitrogen–phosphorus detector (NPD). The column heating program was run from $2 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ to $2 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ at a rate of $1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ per min. The detector was set at $3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The GC-MS unit was fitted with a $3 0 \\mathrm { m }$ fused silica DB-5 capillary column of $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ internal diameter before $1 \\mu \\mathrm { l }$ samples were injected into the GC/MS using the same column temperature program as for the GC/NPD work. For reproducibility and to correct for day-to-day variation in retention times on the NPD detector, a Sceletium extract sample was run between and after samples. Only semi-quantitative data could be generated for this study due to no standards being readily available at that particular time. A mass spectrometry (MS) method was employed in order to determine several different alkaloids with retention times and analysed chemical isolates were as follows: $4 ^ { \\prime }$ -Odemethylmesembrenol ( $\\mathrm { 1 1 . 5 ~ m i n }$ ; $[ \\mathbf { M } ] ^ { + } 1 2 7 5$ $( 5 5 \\% )$ ), [M-1]+ 1 274 $3 3 \\% )$ , [M-Me]+ 1 260 $( 6 \\% )$ , 232 ( $1 5 \\%$ ), 219 $( 2 8 \\% )$ , 218 $( 3 5 \\% )$ , 204 ( $100 \\%$ ), 137 $( 9 \\% )$ , 110 $( 8 \\% )$ , 96 $( 9 2 \\%$ ), 70 $( 9 8 \\% )$ ), mesembrine ( $1 2 ~ \\mathrm { m i n }$ ; $[ \\mathbf { M } ] ^ { + } 1 \\ 2 8 9$ $( 6 6 \\% )$ , [M-1]+ 1 288 $3 6 \\%$ ), [M-Me]+ 1 274 $9 \\% )$ , 246 $8 \\%$ , 232 ( $1 9 \\%$ ), 219 $( 4 8 \\% )$ 218 $( 9 2 \\% )$ , 204 ( $4 8 \\%$ ), 151 $( 1 1 \\% )$ , 110 $( 4 \\% )$ , 96 ( $100 \\%$ ), 70 $( 8 7 \\% )$ ) and mesembrenone ( $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ ; [M]+ 1 287 $( 2 1 \\% )$ , [M-1] + 1 286 $( 4 \\% )$ , [M-Me]+ 1 272 $2 \\% )$ ), 259 $( 4 \\% )$ , 258 $( 5 \\% )$ ), 244 $( 2 \\% )$ ), 230 $( 3 \\% )$ ), 219 $( 7 \\% )$ , 218 $( 2 \\% )$ , 204 $2 \\%$ ), 149 $( 2 \\% )$ , 110 ( , $, 1 \\% ) , 9 6 ( 2 \\% ) , 7 0 ( 1 0 0 \\% )$ . Out of the species tested, the only species with comparable mesembrine alkaloid levels to that of the S. tortuosum was Aptenia cordifolia. The relative levels of alkaloids as a percentage of the mesembrine pool in Sceletium were 0.3 (7.2 min), 0.2 (8.7 min),  4.6 (9.2 min), 14.4 (11.5 min) and  9.7 ( $1 2 \\mathrm { m i n } \\AA$ , respectively.

        "text": "Methods that allow for high-throughput detection of mesembrine alkaloids are thus sought after for industrial applications. Such methods also need to be less labour intensive and not necessarily require a high level of technical know-how for them to be placed in routine use, more especially to use them as a quality assurance measure and for the standardisation of manufactured products derived from Sceletium. As an example; Patnala and Kanfer, (2008) investigated the analytical technique of capillary electrophoresis (CE) as a possible method to study isolated phytochemicals from Sceletium as well as commercially available Sceletium supplements. This is a technique where electrophoretic mobilities under the influence of an applied electric field enable the separation of charged components. This analytical technique allows for the rapid and efficient separation of compounds leading to rapid analysis (Li, 1992). The technique is favourable due to its high efficacy and efficiency, wide application for both scientific laboratories and industrial manufacturers plus it requires low running costs during experimentation. Major compounds and biomarkers were extracted from Sceletium, namely, mesembrine, mesembrenone and $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone and two other compounds, mesembranol and epimesembranol, were produced by performing a hydrogenation on a pure chemical isolate of mesembrine. The CE analysis was paired with a diode array detector (DAD) and a UV detector before NMR analysis was also performed for the characterisation of phytochemicals. Separation of individual alkaloids was carried out by $5 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ effective length, fused silica capillary tubing $\\mathrm { 5 0 m i . d . } \\times 3 6 0 \\mathrm { m o . d . }$ ). Capillaries were conditioned with 1 M NaOH solution for 30 min, 0.1 M NaOH solution for the next $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m i n }$ followed by water for $4 0 ~ \\mathrm { m i n }$ , with pressure of $> 2 5 0 0$ mbar. Washing of the capillaries between consecutive injections to ensure optimal charge density on the capillary wall was performed with water (4 min), 1 M NaOH (2 min), 0.1 M NaOH (2 min) and a final washing step with water for 5 min was included in the method. Conditions during analysis were: ambient temperature of $2 2 \\pm 2 { \\ } ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , applied voltage of $+ 1 6 \\mathrm { k V }$ with a voltage ramp of $+ 6 \\mathrm { k V / s }$ and background electrolyte (BGE) $\\mathrm { N a H _ { 2 } P O _ { 4 } } { \\cdot } 2 \\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ ( $\\mathrm { 5 0 ~ m M } ,$ ). For this particular study, the $\\mathrm { \\ p H }$ was adjusted to 1.5 with ${ \\mathrm { H } } _ { 3 } { \\mathrm { P O } } _ { 4 }$ . Before this study, there was a paucity of reports on commercialised products of S. tortuosum despite an industry that had become established in South Africa. The study found the average content of mesembrine per tablet to be $1 6 4 . 3 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g }$ per $1 2 \\mathrm { m g }$ dose of a tablet. Sensitivity and reproducibility were also an important consideration and the authors confirmed that their protocol was both sensitive and reproducible. They did this through an analysis of inter-day variation over 3 days and the precision recorded for mesembrine, as a quality control standard, was less than $4 \\%$ . Importantly, the limits of detection (1.5 $\\mathrm { { g } / \\mathrm { { m l } } } )$ ) and quantitation $( 2 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { m l } )$ of the method were also reported by the authors. However, the exact species of Sceletium is not reported on in this study which hinders the reproducibility of this work as one can merely assume that the focus was on the commercialised plant, S. tortuosum. It should be noted that there were some encountered difficulties during experimentation as the method could not conclusively distinguish between compounds with similar $m / z$ values (diastereomers at m/z 292).  Correct taxonomic identities for Sceletium species need to be accurate as these plants are difficult to distinguish from their anatomical structures and chemotaxonomic markers have not always played a significant role in delineating sister species from each other (Patnala and Kanfer, 2013).

The method showed repeatable, precise, and appropriate resolution of alkaloids for quality control of mesembrine-type alkaloids. Prior to this study, poor validation data had been presented on any analytical techniques described for Sceletium. The analytical tools used were an HPLC system connected to a UV and PDA detector. Further structural data was supported by NMR spectra. Two different columns were used in the HPLC system, namely, Luna® ${ \\bf C } _ { 1 8 } \\left( 2 \\right) , 5 \\thinspace \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ , $1 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\times 4 . 6 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ i.d. and Hypersil $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ $1 5 0 \\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 4 . 6 \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ i.d $\\mathbf { C } _ { 1 8 }$ column. The lack of standards resulted in several alkaloids assayed via chromatography whose identities were unknown to the researchers as no published data on these metabolites was available.

The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, recovery and limits of detection. Unfortunately, this study did not report on what species of Sceletium they had extracted the phytochemicals from, which is an issue in the reproducibility of this study.  To iterate, this is highly problematic when some of the Sceletium species are difficult to distinguish from each other as they are similar in their appearance and their taxonomy is rather ambiguous (Patnala and Kanfer, 2013).

        "text": "Chemotypic variation observed in Sceletium (Roscher et al., 2012; Shikanga et al., 2012d; Zhao et al., 2018) may be due to the ability of plants to exhibit phenotypic plasticity to cope with their environments and climates (Nicotra et al., 2010). Phenotypic plasticity enables plants with a standard genome to adapt their phenotype in response to environmental pressures assisting with survival (Nicotra et al., 2010). This phenotypic plasticity is often correlated to metabolomic differences in the plants in response to their environments, an example of this was observed in Hippophaë rhamnoides (Kortesniemi et al., 2017). The study of chemical variation linked to plant-environment effects can thus easily be achieved using phytochemical analytical techniques. ",

        "text": "The field of plant metabolomics is making major contributions to our understanding of plant biochemistry and metabolism as a metabolomics workflow can facilitate a comprehensive compilation of metabolites within a particular cell, tissue or organ but large-scale experiments are notoriously difficult to interpret. In such instances, the complexity of these data sets is enormous and they cannot easily be processed with classical statistics (Van der Kooy et al., 2008), consequently principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) analysis have been employed.  These types of multivariate statistical applications reduce the dimensionality of the data enabling better pattern recognition that can be correlated to the analysed samples. Shikanga et al. (2012d), performed a chemical analysis of different populations located at 12 different sites of $S$ . tortuosum and analysed these samples by GC-MS to gain an understanding of chemotypic variation. The aerial parts of the plants were dried at $3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for two weeks after which material was pulverised, sonicated and extracted by an acid-base extraction method as reported by Alali et al. (2008) with slight modifications in the sulfuric acid used (0.5 M; $2 4 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m l }$ ). Extracts were sonicated and vortexed, followed by transferring and neutralising the supernatant with $20 \\%$ aqueous ammonia. The organic phase was separated by dichloromethane and evaporated to powder (the same was applied to commercial samples). For GC-MS analysis, $2 \\mu \\mathrm { l }$ was injected into the system at a pressure setting of 24.0 psi and an inlet temperature of $2 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ Initial oven temperature was kept constant at 259 $^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for $2 \\mathrm { m i n }$ , then increased to $2 6 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ at a rate of $2 0 \\ { ^ { \\circ } } C / { \\operatorname* { m i n } }$ and held constant for 6 min. Separation was achieved using a HP-5MS $5 \\%$ phenyl methyl siloxane column ( $3 0 \\mathrm { m } 2 5 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ i.d. $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ film thickness) and all runs used helium gas, maintained at a flow rate of $1 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m l / m i n }$ . Electron impact ionization was employed (70 eV; 35–550 $\\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { z }$ ) and MS spectra were collected over a run time of $8 ~ \\mathrm { m i n }$ . Total alkaloid yields across species were highly variable ranging from 0.11 to $1 . 9 9 \\%$ of dry plant weight (dw).  By using this approach, the authors could confirm the presence of different chemotypes that exist in nature and five chemotypes were identified in the different populations. These chemotypes were differentiated from each other based on four identified alkaloids which occurred at higher concentrations in the Calitzdorp populations with a total of $1 . 6 6 \\%$ alkaloid as a yield. Purchased products were validated to be composed of several different mesembrine alkaloids with mesembrine occurring at a range of 42.26 to $8 2 . 9 4 ~ \\%$ . This study showed the robustness of the GC-MS method in generating quality assurance standards for both wild-harvested plant materials and purchased products. In another study by Shikanga et al. (2012b), both GC-MS and ultra-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector (RP‐UHPLC PDA) were used as the metabolite profiling techniques but in this work, the acid-base extraction reported was compared to the use of methanol and water, that had previously tested in another study by Shikanga et al. (2011).  The acid-based extraction was preferred as a method as it was reported to show better extraction of pyrrolizidine alkaloids that is known to have considerable toxic effects when consumed (Alali et al., 2008). However, no quantitative measurements were conducted for both water or methanol as extractants and so the authors make no mention of the quantities obtained when comparing these solvents. Details focus mainly on chromatographic aspects and the chromatography was achieved by a Waters Acquity reversed phase UHPLC BEH $\\mathbf { C } _ { 1 8 }$ ( $2 . 1 \\times 1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , $1 . 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ particle size) column and a Van Guard pre-column $( 2 . 1 \\times 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , $1 . 7 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ). The analysis of samples in GC-MS was analysed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph, coupled with a 5973 mass spectrometer. The column used in GC-MS was g a HP-5MS $5 \\%$ phenyl methyl siloxane column $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } \\times$ $2 5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ i.d. $\\times \\ 0 . 2 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ film thickness). The method was validated in terms of linearity, limits of detection, repeatability and recovery. The method gave satisfactory separation of peaks (resolution) and quantification was possible in both analytical techniques. The analytes targeted for quantification were, mesembrenol $( 5 3 . 4 4 \\pm 1 . 1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { g . m l ^ { - 1 } } )$ ), mesembranol $( 2 5 . 2 3 \\pm 0 . 6 8 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g . m l ^ { - 1 } } ,$ , mesembrenone $( 3 5 . 4 2 \\pm 0 . 6 6 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g . m l ^ { - 1 } } ,$ ), mesembrine $( 1 3 . 4 7 \\pm 0 . 3 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g . m l ^ { - 1 } } ,$ ). Data obtained from both analytical methods were found to be similar. However, lower levels of alkaloids could be identified by RP‐UHPLC PDA. The findings from this study indicate that the method is effective for the identification and quantification of four pharmacologically important alkaloids making these methods suitable for quality assurance procedures that may be employed during the production of phytopharmaceuticals based on S. tortuosum.

        "text": "Shikanga et al. (2012c) further developed a method for the rapid and simple identification of alkaloids in S. tortuosum raw and wild-harvested materials. The intended purpose of this study was to develop an analytical technique for the routine analysis of psychoactive alkaloids in S. tortuosum these products. The analytical tool used was a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) densitometric method as this is a superior and more sophisticated form of TLC that is fast and robust for quality testing of botanical materials. One of the advantages of using this method is the automation of the different steps that would mainly be performed by hand with a normal TLC. This makes this method more powerful for metabolite fingerprinting, increasing its resolution and enabling quantitative measurement of phytochemicals.  Because it is simple with many experiments being run at low costs, compared to GC-MS and/or LC-MS, it allows for rapid and parallel analysis of samples making it a high-throughput and reliable technology, that is now routinely used in many different settings for herbal drug authentication. As part of the protocol development steps, the HPTLC data of  Shikanga et al. (2012c) were compared to a reference method that was previously developed in their laboratory based on GC-MS data of Shikanga et al. (2012b) using extracts generated with their acid-base method. Preparation and extraction of wild plant and commercial material $_ { \\textrm { 2 g } }$ per extraction) was performed as in Shikanga et al. (2012d). Sample application was performed using a $2 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ syringe and connected to nitrogen gas. Quantification was done by (UV)/vis densitometer, in absorbance mode at $2 8 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, and the upper and lower limits of detection. The HPTLC method was able to separate alkaloids, however, Rf values were quite close between mesembrenone (0.71) and mesembrine (0.60). Even so, peak purity was confirmed by UV-Vis. The repeatability of the method was confirmed by ANOVA but did not identify significant differences in analysis results between and within days $( \\mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ . Quantification of alkaloids in ng/band were, mesembrenol $( 2 7 5 . 0 9 \\pm 2 . 3 4 ) \\$ , mesembranol $2 1 7 . 1 5 \\pm 3 . 4 0 \\$ , mesembrenone $( 1 9 2 . 3 8 \\pm 2 . 2 7 ) \\$ ), mesembrine ( $1 6 0 . 0 9 \\pm 3 . 7 5$ ). Data obtained from both analytical methods, HPTLC and GC-MS were found to be similar in terms of the power of detection. The HPTLC densitometric technique was found to effectively separate the biomarker mesembrine alkaloids from the other phytochemicals in the plant. This particular technique was thus recommended because it is simple and high-throughput in its application produces fast, reliable and reproducible results and can be routinely applied as an effective tool in the regular quality control of commercial and wild-harvested S. tortuosum samples.

        "text": "The first study to use the analytical technique of non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (NACE-MS) for the separation of alkaloids in wild and commercial material was aimed at analysing wild and commercial plant materials was extracted using methanol as a solvent from S. joubertii (syn. S. tortuosum) (Roscher et al., 2012). The study aimed to analyse the alkaloid profile of Sceletium in an effort to provide a tool for the relative quantification of alkaloids in different Sceletium preparations. Another point of interest in this study was to investigate the influence fermentation would have on alkaloid profiles. Wild (calyx, stems and leaves) and commercial plant material was extracted using methanol as a solvent. Samples were also fermented and their alkaloid profiles were obtained. The fermentation was performed by crushing the whole wild harvested plant and this included the calyx, stems and leaves as plant parts. After homogenisation of the material, it was then stored in an airtight transparent plastic container, left in the sun for 8 days and vacuum dried later. All analyses were performed on capillary electrophoresis coupled to an Ion Trap 6330. The sheath liquid used in the capillaries $5 0 \\mathrm { m }$ id, length $7 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ ) was $5 \\%$ glacial acetic acid in isopropanol:water (66:34; v/v), at a flow rate of $4 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { L / m i n } }$ . The method's mean relative standard deviation for repeatability was $0 . 2 \\%$ and $7 . 7 \\%$ , respectively ( $\\mathbf { \\bar { n } = }$ 5) while the mean dynamic range was $0 . 1 { - } 5 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ . The CE separation was performed by applying $3 0 \\mathrm { k V }$ , resulting in a current of $1 6 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { A }$ . Identification of alkaloids was tentatively determined using mass fragmentation data and $m / z$ values in comparison with previously published literature. The separation power of this technique is evident in its ability to separate fragments with similar $m / z$ ratios, whereas the technique by Patnala and Kanfer, (2008) was unable to discriminate between two diastereomers of $4 ^ { \\circ }$ -O-demethylmesembranol. The high selectivity of this method is evident by its ability to distinguish the diastereomers of $4 ^ { , }$ -O-demethylmesembranol (retention time of $1 2 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { m i n } \\cdot$ ), since then no other analytical techniques have been able to identify it (Smith et al., 1998; Patnala and Kanfer, 2008, 2010). The NACE-MS method thus proved an effective method for separating isobaric structures in Sceletium samples with good resolving power. However, no quantification data were presented in this paper. Furthermore, no comparison is made with a reference technique with the same samples. The technique proved effective in the relative quantification of alkaloids from wild and commercial samples of Sceletium. However, the authors do not present any evidence validating the method in terms of linearity, limits of detection and repeatability. Nevertheless, this technique provides novel opportunities to study samples that potentially have diastereomers and isobaric structures. ",

Hyperspectral imaging is proving a valuable tool in the authentication of herbal products, but it is heavily reliant on good statistical models to make predictions after test materials have been scanned.

The purpose of this study was to offer an additional robust tool to reduce the adulteration of Sceletium with species that may contain fewer alkaloids of interest and ultimately assist in the authentication of Sceletium material.

This study aimed to develop a technique to distinguish between samples of Sceletium as a quality control tool. Six species were selected based on venation patterns as distinguishing morphological characteristics are often used in taxonomy to assign species identities. Selection of plant material was based on leaf venation, with plants being grouped into the ‘tortuosum’ (S. tortuosum, S. expansum and S. strictum) or ‘emarcidum’ type (S. emarcidum, S. exaltum and S. rigidum). The species of $S _ { \\mathbf { \\alpha } }$ . varians and S. archeri were not considered in this study, in fact, these species have largely been ignored in terms of their phytochemical profiles. Plant samples were obtained from being grown in cultivation, dried at $8 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and stored for extraction. Samples were extracted with methanol, sonicated and filtered with a final concentration of $\\mathrm { \\sim } 1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / m l }$ .

S. strictum was found to contain measurable amounts of mesembrine, mesembrenone and one of two epimers, 4’- O-demethyl-mesembrenone or $\\mathbf { \\nabla } _ { 4 } ,$ -O-demethyl-mesembrenol but mesembranol and epimesembranol were in minute relative amounts.  Interestingly, the ‘émarcidum’ types illustrated a complete absence of the mesembrine class of alkaloids traditionally associated with Sceletium such as mesembrine, $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone, mesembrenone and mesembranol. Instead, the émarcidum group had O-demethyl-mesembrenone and O-methyl-joubertiamine as the more prominent metabolites and out of the émarcidum’ types, S. exaltum showed an accumulation of mesembrine.  The findings of this study clearly indicate that the distribution of mesembrine-type alkaloids is not distributed across the genus and is limited to only a few species, highlighting the importance of quality control testing in the Sceletium genus.

The conditions of the ESI-MS system were: a capillary temperature of $2 4 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and a spray voltage maintained at $4 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { k V }$ for all compounds. Within the MS/MS mode, collision induced dissociation (CID) was induced for the detection of protonated molecular ions $[ \\mathrm { M } \\mathrm { + H } ] ^ { + }$ , enabling a better collection of fingerprints for each alkaloid in this system.

The investigation did not report on any dominant structures that could be used for the chemotaxonomic classification of this species, as none of the peaks observed corresponded with the standard alkaloids found in Sceletium species. The versatility of this method may be of value in characterising other alkaloids from Sceletium aside from the mesembrine-type alkaloids. It has the power to be employed routinely for a chemotaxonomic delineation of Sceletium species because it can separate different isomeric derivatives that are often neglected or difficult to define in the chemical analysis of Sceletium phytoextracts. Unlike the UPLC-UV method (Patnala and Kanfer, 2010) and the RP-UHPLC method (Shikanga et al., 2012b), the ESI-MS method was able to identify $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone and epimesembranol. It was effective in qualitatively differentiating isobaric, isomeric and epimer compounds. Alkaloids of this nature often prove a challenge due to their similar chemical structures, where mesembrenone and $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone differ by the position of a double bond (isometric) and mesembranol and epimesembranol differ by configurations linked to epimer or diastereomer formation.

Metabolite profiling can thus be a complimentary tool to other techniques for the detection of adulterants in herbal medicines. To this end, Lesiak et al. (2016) performed analysis on S. tortuosum commercial material using direct analysis in real time ionization coupled with high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-HRTOF-MS) in positive ion mode. The method was employed as an authentication tool to identify adulterated samples and found that some commercially available samples were indeed spiked with the banned herbal stimulant ephedrine.

Commercial powder mixtures were conveniently analysed directly by dipping the closed end of a melting point capillary tube into the powder substance and then between the DART ion source and mass spectrometer inlet.

The authors only quantified two of the detectable compounds, mesembranol ranging from 0.3 to $7 . 0 \\%$ and mesembrine at $5 . 1 \\%$ but relative amounts are not available for any of the other compounds in the authors’ report. Quantification of Sceletium alkaloids is often constrained by the availability of pure reference standards. Despite this, this analytical tool displayed sufficient capability of searching for other alkaloid types within the Sceletium samples. It also provided a rapid forensic diagnostic tool of commercial samples sold in the USA, highlighting illicit practices in the manufacture of Sceletium-derived products that are of regulatory concern.

Supporting the method used by Lesiak et al. (2016), the use of direct analysis in real time–high-resolution mass spectrometry (DARTHRMS) in positive ion mode, resulted in effective and rapid detection and quantification of hordenine and mesmebrine-type alkaloids. The settings of the DART ion source were set with a heater temperature of $3 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , grid voltage of $2 5 0 \\mathrm { V }$ and helium flowrate of $2 . 0 \\mathrm { L . s ^ { - 1 } }$ .  Extracts were prepared from commercial Sceletium-based products. The analytical method was able to resolve hordenine as a biomarker in all commercial samples along with the mesembrine-type alkaloids, mesembrenone, mesembrine, mesembrenol and mesembrinol. The study provided a reproducible and robust protocol for the quantification of hordenine and mesembrine-type alkaloids from Sceletium that could support the forensic relevance of the natural product’s use.

        "text": "The main concern with the presence of ephedrine in natural products is that it has been noted as being fatal when combined with caffeine or other over-the-counter drugs and could potentially be harmful when consumed with Sceletium products (Haller and Benowitz, 2000). An advantage of DART-HRTOF-MS is that sample preparation is not needed. As a consequence, there is no loss of phytochemical constituents due to solvent bias as samples are analysed in their unaltered form. Techniques such as LC-MS and GC-MS may not identify adulterants such as ephedrine due to preferential take up of hordenine due to its polarity over the adulterant ephedrine as these are constitutional isomers of each other, which both occurred at a nominal $m / z$ of 166. The authors emphasised that without the use of DART-HRTOF-MS, the compounds would not have been separated and the adulterant would have thus become more difficult to notice and identify. This study illustrated the utility of the analytical tool for rapid identification of adulterants, specifically ephedrine, in Sceletium. ",

Furthermore, the use of NMR spectroscopy is appropriate for samples where authentic standards are not available (Leiss et al., 2011) for a wide range of metabolites that may occur within a particular plant specimen, such as the case with Sceletium. Despite this NMR spectroscopy does have limitations in some cases as without the use of two-dimensional NMR, absolute quantitation is thus not possible (Verpoorte et al., 2007).

(2018) used both $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 } H }$ -NMR spectroscopy and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to analyse wild samples of S. tortuosum in an effort to elucidate chemotypic variation between two populations groups (Western Cape and Northern Cape) over 23 localities in South Africa, using a metabolomics-driven strategy (Table 1). The populations were collected from various locations over the Western and Northern Cape. The study of plant metabolomes has seen an unprecedented rise since the adoption of systems biology approaches in biological sciences and NMR-metabolomics can be the preferred choice for this purpose (Verpoorte et al., 2007; Leiss et al., 2011). The advantage of using NMR for generating an overview of the plant metabolome lies in its vast applications, ranging from quality control of foods and botanicals to studies related to investigating the pharmacological activity of phytochemicals. A limitation of NMR spectroscopy is that without the use of two-dimensional NMR, absolute quantitation is not possible (Verpoorte et al., 2007). The plants collected at different localities studied by Zhao et al. (2018) using NMR were growing under differing biogeographic environments. The Western Cape samples were collected from semi-desert, dry zones with winter to spring rainfall. On the other hand, the Northern Cape samples were collected from a similar climatic region that is also known to be semi-arid with summer rainfall. There were also other samples collected from moist areas that would have experienced rain in both winter and summer. For NMR, plant samples ( $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m g }$ each) were extracted with $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m L }$ deuterated methanol (CD3OD, $9 9 . 8 \\%$ D). The NMR instrument was run at $4 9 9 . 7 9 \\mathrm { M H z }$ for ${ } ^ { 1 } \\mathrm { H }$ and $1 2 5 . 6 7 ~ \\mathrm { M H z }$ for $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ NMR. Samples were sonicated and centrifuged. Methanol was also used for extraction purposes of the harvested plants before GC-MS. Gas chromatography settings were performed on a fused silica capillary column ( $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } 0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ i. d $\\mathrm { ~ x ~ } 0 . 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ film thickness) with a carrier gas of helium ( $\\mathrm { 1 . 0 ~ m L / m i n }$ . For the UPLC method, the extraction method used in this study was the same as that of Shikanga et al. (2012d). The column used in the unit was a $\\mathbf { C } _ { 1 8 }$ column ( $1 5 0 \\mathrm { m m } 2 . 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ , i.d., $1 . 7 \\mathrm { m m }$ particle size) at a temperature of $3 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The mobile phase was $0 . 1 \\%$ ammonium hydroxide (Solvent A) and $90 \\%$ acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of $0 . 3 \\mathrm { \\ m L / m i n }$ .  The study found that NMR together with a chemometric analysis could be an effective tool to distinguish between populations of Sceletium and identify notable biomarkers in each population. A significant finding from the study was that $N .$ -demethyl-N-formylmesembrenone, a biomarker that had not been identified in Sceletium before, characterised one of the population groups from the Western Cape. Separation into groups was achieved by differences identified in biomarker groups of pinitol, alkaloids and alkyl amines. The study reported that the production of alkaloids may be due to genetic composition rather than climatic conditions since plants in close proximity to each other produced variable amounts of alkaloids, suggesting that climate was not a contributing factor to diversity in chemical profiles. The findings from this study suggested that the collection of Sceletium for commercial purposes should be done from cultivated samples instead of wild samples, due to the highly variable alkaloid distribution across populations that was noticeable between and within groups. This alkaloid variability was predominantly observed in the Western Cape samples where $2 . 8 \\%$ of samples were devoid of any of the four mesembrine alkaloids of interest, namely, mesembrine, mesembrenol, mesembrenone and mesembranol. These data correlated with reports from Shikanga et al. (2012d) where $4 . 2 \\%$ of samples from the Western Cape were lacking in mesembrine alkaloids. The Northern Cape populations were more consistent in their chemical profiles between studied samples. ",

        "text": "Freund et al. (2018) employed an analytical technique that had never been performed on these plants coined leaf spray mass spectrometry (leaf spray MS) (Table 1). Additionally, the setup included tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) collected in positive ionization mode. This technique circumvents the separation of plant metabolites using chromatography and offers a direct MS injection without the need for sample preparation or extraction, with minimal technical adjustments to the ionization source being required. An advantage of this tool is the absence of lengthy extraction protocols and solvent bias that may introduce artifacts or prove inefficient in the recovery of phytochemicals as these may not always be extracted.  Leaf spray MS can directly analyse plant tissue providing rapid generation of qualitative and quantitative data albeit accurate quantification is more tricky with this approach. The setting for the MS system was: sheath, auxiliary, and sweep gas to 0; the spray voltage to $2  { \\mathrm { ~ - ~ } } 5  { \\mathrm { ~ \\textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }$ ; the capillary temperature to $1 5 0 - 2 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ; and the S-lens RF level to 50. The phytochemicals putatively identified from S. tortuosum material were, dihydrojoubertiamine (m/z 262.1794), O-demethyl-mesembrenone (m/z 274.1431), O-demethyl-mesembrine (m/z 276.1583), N-demethyl-mesembrine (m/z 276.1583), O-demethyldihydro-mesembrenone (m/z 3 276.1583), N-demethyl-dihydro-mesembrenone $( m / z ~ 2 7 6 . 1 5 8 3 ,$ ), mesembrenone (m/z 288.1587), mesembrine (m/z 290.1742) and dihydro-mesembrine (m/z 292.1897). The method was successful in analysing intact plant material reducing the amount of processing needed. For leaf spray MS to have wider application for in planta analysis of metabolites, optimisations in terms of plant preparation, presence or absence of solvents, volume of solvents, voltage amplitude and distance from the ion inlet may be necessary. Some other limitation of this analytical technique is its low dynamic range, resulting in the most abundant metabolites solely being identifiable.  Some of the minor alkaloids or structurally similar alkaloids that require stronger resolving power require greater and more sophisticated technical expertise for their detection.  Despite this, the analytical method proved to be a powerful tool that eliminated chromatography for the identification of the main phytochemicals from S. tortuosum. ",

(2018) performed a study to assess the quality of herbal tea blends using hyperspectral imaging and UPLC-MS, in an effort to develop a tool for the quality control of various Sceletium tea blends. Five batches of herbal tea that were claimed by the manufacturers to contain a S. tortuosum and Cyclopia genistoides (commonly known as honeybush) mixture were obtained pulverised and subjected to hyperspectral imaging without any further processing. For UPLC-MS analysis, the tea blends were prepared by adding boiling water $( 2 3 7 ~ \\mathrm { m l } )$ to $\\mathrm { 1 . 5 ~ g }$ of plant tissue. The test specimens were stirred continuously for 25 minutes before $2 ~ \\mu \\mu 1$ was injected into the UPLC instrument. The column used was $\\mathbf { C } _ { 1 8 }$ column ( $1 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\times 2 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , i.d., $1 . 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ particle size) maintained at $3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The solvent system was Solvent A: $0 . 1 \\%$ ammonium hydroxide Solvent A: $0 . 1 \\%$ formic acid Solvent B: $90 \\%$ acetonitrile at a flow rate of $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m l / m i n }$ . A gradient elution was applied with a total run time of 8 minutes. The electrospray mode was set to positive ion. For the hyperspectral imaging, the same instrument settings were used as in Shikanga et al. (2013b) and applied as a rapid and non-destructive method for the quality control of the tea blends. Using a PLS-DA model, the procedure had a $9 5 . 8 \\%$ predictive ability providing high degrees of sensitivity with a stronger metabolite feature selection. The five tea blends were predicted to only contain S. tortuosum and $C$ . genistoides with no adulterants or contaminants. Quantitatively, C. genistoides was found to be in higher amounts across the samples $( > 9 7 \\%$ ), while S. tortuosum was found in lower quantities ( < $3 \\%$ ). After UPLC-MS, the chemometric technique confirmed the identity of S. tortuosum and facilitated the identification of three out of the four alkaloids that occur in this species that were of interest. The alkaloids found were: mesembrine $( m / z 2 9 0 . 1 6 0 9 )$ ), mesembrenone (m/z 288.1460) and mesembranol (m/z 292.1764). The absence of the fourth commonly occurring alkaloid may be due to it eluting with other peaks becoming obscured during analysis but the role of chemotype variability in the samples could not be ruled out (Roscher et al., 2012; Shikanga et al., 2013b). For this study, the  UPLC-MS conditions were optimised for $C .$ . genistoides but these conditions were not necessarily optimal for S. tortuosum. A major limitation of this particular study was that the UPLC-MS procedure alone could thus not conclusively efficiently distinguish the plant components of the herbal mixtures that contained S. tortuosum along with another species. Additionally, the quantitative determination of phytochemicals in a mixture may be biased depending on which protocol of analysis is being employed. ",

This was interestingly the second time that channaine was detected since its initial characterisation by Abou-Donia et al. (1978). The plant extract was prepared by collecting macerating the aerial parts of S. tortuosum and air drying the material prior to an acid-base extraction Shikanga et al. (2011).

This kind of information is largely missing in terms of novel alkaloids that become periodically identified in Sceletium samples by different research groups. The isolated alkaloids were established to be precursors of the alkaloid channaine identified in previous studies (Abou-Donia et al., 1978; Veale et al., 2018). It was ruled out that these phytochemicals were artefacts as a result of processing due to their presence in fresh material.

These challenges have been reported to be overcome to some extent by high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) (Shikanga et al., 2011) and non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (NACE-MS) (Roscher et al., 2012). The technique of HSCCC allows for efficient separation as it is an all-liquid method allowing great recovery (Shikanga et al., 2011) while NACE-MS allowed for the sensitive identification of diastereomers in material (Roscher et al., 2012). It should be noted that the technique has not been rigorously tested for reproducibility in larger data sets. In terms of analytical techniques for rapid quality control, tools such as DART-HR-TOF-MS (Lesiak et al., 2016) and leaf spray MS (with MS/MS) (Freund et al., 2018). These techniques are robust, rapid and require very little plant material. However, it should be noted that the limitations of the latter technique are that it still requires optimization. For leaf spray MS, the succulence of Sceletium spp. is ideal and advantageous as its application is well suited to analyse fresh plant material containing high amounts of water, which may be a challenge for other methods.

Overall analytical techniques should be performed to assess sensitivity, reproducibility and comparison to a reference method (i.e. GC-MS). From the current state of analytical techniques used in the quality control of Sceletium, GC-MS, LC-MS and HPLC-MS will continue to remain popular going forward (Table 1). However, for the effective identification of adulterants and contamination in samples, more advanced tools in tandem with different detectors need to be utilized. Two analytical techniques that stand out for the rapid analysis of samples are direct analysis in real time ionization coupled with high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-HR-TOF-MS) (Lesiak et al., 2016) and leaf spray MS (Freund et al., 2018). These methods do not require the processing of material and as such there is no solvent bias, loss of phytochemicals during extraction, or artifacts from extraction procedures. Nevertheless, the limitations of these methods are that the machines are not common, expensive and require specialized components that may prove to be more laborious to assemble. With these in mind, the application of NMR analysis coupled with chemometrics (Zhao et al., 2018) will also gain more popularity in quality control assurance practices.  Methods that are non-destructive to the plant tissues such as hyperspectral imaging may provide additional analytical power for use in commercial settings (Sandasi et al., 2016, 2018).

The plant material is fermented for several days before being dried for storage and use (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). Traditionally, the Khoe-Sān people of South Africa prepared the plant material by crushing and fermenting the aerial parts of Sceletium, which was then placed in an animal skin bag for several days (Chen and Viljoen, 2019). It has been reported that in recent years, plastic bags are used as an alternative to canvas or skin bags (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). The mood-elevating activity is currently suspected to be linked to four mesembrine-type major alkaloids, mesembrine, mesembranol, mesembrenone, and mesembrenol (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). Fermentation is thought to enhance the levels of these alkaloids and reduce oxalates which in turn increases the mood-elevating activity of Sceletium (Smith et al., 1996). There seems to be some incongruency in reports related to the effects of fermentation which further highlights work that needs to be done to better understand the metabolic pathways of these alkaloids and at which steps to manipulate levels.

(1998) used the plastic bag fermentation followed by GC-MS analysis. Their findings indicated that the mesembrine alkaloid composition was comparable to that of the oven-dried $( 8 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ samples. However, in the fermented sample, there was a significant increase in mesembrenone levels whilst levels of $4 ^ { \\circ } { - } O .$ demethylmesembrenol and mesembrine decreased. Patnala and Kanfer, (2009) further investigated the role of fermentation in alkaloid composition in Sceletium using HPLC-MS, where levels of mesembrine decreased (from 1.33 to $0 . 0 5 \\%$ (w/w)), with suspected transformation into $\\Delta ^ { 7 }$ mesembrenone. Roscher et al. (2012), also investigated the change in alkaloid composition as a result of sample fermentation. No qualitative data were presented in this study instead the authors report that no overall change in the alkaloid concentrations as a result of fermentation were detected. The studies conducted up until this point were suggestive that the traditional processing of the plant material through fermentation did not affect the overall potency of the material as there was a decrease or no change in mesembrine levels (Smith et al., 1998; Patnala and Kanfer, 2009; Roscher et al., 2012). However, the most recent study by Chen and Viljoen, (2019), reported that the total alkaloid content increased as a result of fermentation. They reported that while mesembrine levels increased (from below $1 . 6 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ to $7 . 4 0 { - } 2 0 . 8 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { g / m L }$ ), there was only a marginal increase in mesembrenol and mesembranol content and a significant decrease in mesembrenone content. This study supports the traditional preparation of Sceletium plant material to increase the mood-elevating effects of S. tortuosum. It may be worthwhile to investigate if phytochemical formation or breakdown is dependent on $\\mathrm { \\ p H }$ in these analyses and that future analyses should control for this.

Currently, the biosynthetic pathway of mesembrine-type alkaloids as suggested by Jeffs et al. (1971a), proposed that the perhydroindole portion of mesembrine comes from tyrosine and the aromatic group is derived from phenylalanine. The cinnamic acid derivatives are produced from phenylalanine but the $3 ^ { \\circ }$ -aryl oxygen substituent is proposed to be introduced in later steps involving a biosynthetic reaction with sceletenone, mesembrenone and 4’O-demethylmesembrenone (Jeffs et al., 1978). Since studies in 1971 and 1978, the biosynthetic pathway has not been revised and we thus suggest this become a future avenue of investigation to better understand how fermentation affects the alkaloid profile, pinpointing not only biochemical changes that occur but also the key enzymes and genetic regulatory steps that may control this metabolism.

        "text": "Although there is limited current ethnobotanical information on the prevalence of use of the Sceletium genus in modern times, the work by Philander, (2011) focusing on a group of Rastafarian herbalists who are the main commodifiers of traditional medicines in the Western Cape of South Africa, clearly points out to the importance of S. tortuosum as the main species that is collected as a phytomedicine to reduce depression and anxiety, where the plant is mainly administered through drinking it as a herbal tea or by chewing.  Anecdotal evidence for its use in indigenous medicine does however exist. For example, the community of Rastafarian herbalists that belong to the Cape Bush Doctors organisation use it together with Cannabis sativa, for spiritual purposes (Olivier, L, personal communication). More recently, in popular culture, Sceletium has been used for recreational for its mood-elevating and anxiolytic effects. With the increased public interest in biogenic drugs such as Sceletium, numerous companies have appeared online selling Sceletium in raw powdered form, tablets, teas and snuffs. This increased popularity may well pose a significant conservational threat to the species if populations are collected from the wild. As evident in multiple studies, distinguishing between the morphological characteristics can be challenging (Patnala and Kanfer, 2010) without the consultation of specialised botanists or analytical tools. It appears that some of the present-day uses by indigenous communities of the plant are consistent with the historical uses i.e. for euphoria and as a mood elevator (Smith et al., 1996; Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). However, it is unclear if more rural communities where these plants are found are still relying on using these plants for hunger and as a thirst suppressant. ",

There are, however, several reports on the ‘mood elevation’ activity, particularly focussed on the potential of Sceletium to aid with anxiety and depression. Recently, there have been more studies that are focused on the pharmacology of Sceletium, notably in areas linked to in vivo actions and clinical trials of tested extracts (Table 3). The body of pharmacology research on Sceletium is quite extensive, as seen below, with the majority of the reported biological activity being interactions with the central nervous system (CNS) and related neurological pathways (anti-depressant, anxiolytic and psychoactive activity). The scope of the observed CNS-activity is broad with observed anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity demonstrated for extracts and isolated compounds of Sceletium (Table 3). Additionally, there are more in vivo behavioural inquiries on rats using a range of pharmaceutical tests (Fig. 5d) exhibiting CNS-related activities ranging from suppressant (e.g. anxiolytic and sedative) to excitatory (e.g. antidepressant) activity. Although there is a shift to more in vivo studies, there is still much to be tested in terms of different chemotypes and to understand the pharmacokinetics of individual phytochemicals and potential synergism between phytochemicals, aside from mesembrine.

This particular study did not test individual alkaloids, and such could not pinpoint the plant constituent responsible for the observed activity.

The extract showed binding at the serotonin (5-HT) transporter, δ2- and $\\mu$ -opioid receptors, the cholecystokinin-1 receptor, $> 8 0 \\%$ inhibition at GABA receptors (non-selective) and PDEs 3 and 4 (Harvey et al., 2011). Some of the therapeutic applications of these targets are emesis, obesity, anxiety and migraine linked to the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (Pithadia and Jain, 2009). The δ2- and $\\mu$ -opioid receptors are involved in maintaining epileptic seizure, emotional responses, immune function, obesity, cell proliferation, respiratory and cardiovascular control as well as several neurodegenerative disorders (Feng et al., 2012). The cholecystokinin-1 receptor is involved in gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases (Berna and Jensen, 2007). The GABA receptors are involved in pathologies ranging from epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (Wong et al., 2003). The PDE3 receptor is responsible for platelet activation/aggregation (Beca et al., 2011), and vascular smooth muscle proliferation (Beca et al., 2011; Begum et al., 2011), while the PDE4 receptor is responsible for inflammatory conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), rheumatic arthritis (RA), lupus, and neuroinflammation (Li et al., 2018). This report only presented findings on the affinity of  Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ to different receptors. Further studies would need to be investigated for activity against these specific pathologies. Plant extracts have numerous metabolites that work in synergy to affect their biological influence and it is thus possible that multiple metabolites are potentiating the mood-elevated activity aside from mesembrine alone, as suggested by Lubbe et al. (2010). They emphasised that irrespective of fermentation, the crude extracts of S. tortuosum showed greater inhibition of acetylcholinesterase than mesembrine alone. This could be indicative of the possibility that other phytochemicals may be involved in potentiating mood-elevating activity (Lubbe et al., 2010). ",

(2011) study supports ethnobotanical use as a mood-elecator by the observed serotonin transport activity in response to Zembrin $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ . The serotonin receptor influences a myriad of biological and neurological processes such as anxiety, appetite, aggression and depression (Mück-Šeler and Pivac, 2011; Zhang and Stackman, 2015). Evidence of anxiolytic effects of Sceletium in humans (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008) has partially been supported in a study using a rat model of restraint induced stress (Smith, 2011). The binding of compounds to various sites on the 5-HT transporter (SERT) is considered evidence of potential serotonin reuptake inhibition, a common target of antidepressant drugs. A selection of alkaloids, mesembrine, mesembrenone, and mesembrenol, from Sceletium tortuosum, were tested for their affinity for SERT with Ki’s of 1.4, 27, and $6 3 ~ \\mathrm { { n M } }$ , respectively (Harvey et al., 2011). These values were significantly higher than other alkaloids, such as buphanidrine or distichamine, isolated from Amaryllidaceae, with reported Ki’s of 312 and $8 6 8 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ , respectively (Neergaard et al., 2009). These compounds have been found to already possess well-established anti-depressant activity, found in Boophone disticha (L.f.) Herb (Amaryllidaceae) (Neergaard et al., 2009). There is some evidence that argues against Sceletium purely acting as a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), as repeated administration of SSRIs has been linked to hyposensitivity to SSRIs as a result of an up-regulation in PDE4 (Ye et al., 2000). However, it has been demonstrated that PDE4 activity decreased after Sceletium administration (Harvey et al., 2011). ",

Through the selective inhibition of the PDE4 family of enzymes is predicted to generate great functional effects, as evidenced by PDE4 enzymes being a major therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008). Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is the major class of enzymes that mediates the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 has also been identified to play a role in the inflammatory system (Banner and Trevethick, 2004; Dastidar et al., 2007; Li et al., 2018). Harvey et al.

The illegal harvesting and exploitation of S. tortuosum, due to the demand as a recreational drug linked to mood-elevating properties of the mesembrine alkaloids is a driving factor for the dire need for the development of micropropagation techniques. Development of micropropagation techniques with Sceletium could offer a direct and standardised source of mesembrine alkaloids. Sreekissoon et al., (2021b) investigated whether in vitro regeneration of micropropagules with auxins could be acclimatised ex vitro. Sreekissoon et al. (2021a), assessed the effects of smoke water on the germination, seedling vigour and growth of S. tortuosum, the major findings were that seed vigour was highest at smoke water concentrations of 1:1000. A limitation of these studies was that key biomarker compounds were not monitored in the microplant regenerates. The Makunga et al. (2022), study investigated morphotypes of S. tortuosum and the levels of mesembrine and its derivatives. For the first time, the alkaloids, $\\Delta 4$ -mesembrenone, mesembrenol, mesembrine, and mesembranol were reported in the literature (Makunga et al., 2022). The utilisation of micropropagation using the dehydrating and rehydration technique outlined in this report, resulted in in vitro metabolite accumulation comparable to wild-type material collected (Zhao et al., 2018a).

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) flagged Sceletium as a plant of concern when reporting on substances of concern in 2013 as part of a report on the obstacles in the identification and regulation of new psychoactive substances (UNODC, 2013). Due to plant material being crushed upon commercial sale, it is difficult to authenticate plant material. The nature of Sceletium being classified as herbal or dietary supplements often exempts it from mandatory testing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thus, without adequate quality control and authenticating systems in place, herbal product producers can adulterate samples. This has been observed with commercial Sceletium products in Germany, where plant material was laced with the stimulant ephedrine (which has been banned in herbal products and supplements) (Lesiak et al., 2016).

The bibliometric analysis showed that South Africa has established a strong network with researchers working on Sceletium and its medicinal value but there is an apparent lack of synergy and coordination between research groups located in the native land of this genus. The reason for this is not obvious but could be linked to historical networks and collaborations being preferred and strong competition for limited funding between research groups. A higher degree of collaboration is thus foreseen to encourage greater progress in transforming latent botanical assets into consumer products. ",

        "text": "A portion of the current review has highlighted the development of quality control tools for commercial and wild-harvested Sceletium species, with the focus being on S. tortuosum due to its rising commercialisation status in global markets.  With the popularity of Sceletium growing as a recreational natural product, a more diverse range of products emanating from a growing number of manufacturers is an imminent probability. However, the expansion of the industry may bring about an increased frequency of herb-drug adulterations as seen with many other natural products that are popular in commercial settings (Campbell et al., 2013; Seethapathy et al., 2015; Booker et al., 2016). There is thus a critical urgency that is required in the research and development of analytical techniques and protocols that are rapid, robust and reproducible which may be highly efficacious in their detection capacity for adulterants that may occur in products even at minute scales. The inconsistent chemical profiles and various wild chemotypes of S. tortuosum and its sister species in the wild (Zhao et al., 2018a) further necessitate the application of techniques for quality control analysis that have high resolving power. Such techniques need to be able to identify adulterants that would otherwise not be identified due to their similarity in polarity with some of the biomarker compounds. From a practical perspective, these instruments are not always common in laboratories and they are expensive, requiring users to have specialized training and highlysophisticated scientific expertise.

        "text": "The choice of chemo-elite types that can become easily domesticated may assist the production of quality-assured natural products, generating an industry that will gain consumer trust. This is viewed as being of high importance when considering that some S. tortuosum wild types may produce mesembrine alkaloids at exceedingly low concentrations and other Sceletium spp. show a complete lack of the key biomarker compounds that are routinely examined by the phytopharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries (Patnala and Kanfer, 2013). Because the different species are similar to each other, this makes them highly vulnerable to misidentification and incorrect identification and unregulated collection of these plants may set in motion their overharvesting thereby creating serious conservation concerns of the genus. The number of studies looking into genetic approaches for quality control tools is remarkably absent in Sceletium research. DNA fingerprinting and biomarker identification (Klak et al., 2007; Shikanga et al., 2013b; Zhao et al., 2018), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite loci (nuclear short sequence repeats, SSR) have been commonly used for genetic-based quality control (Laurie et al., 2010). The absence of quality pure chemical standards has greatly hindered the absolute quantification of the mesembrine alkaloids in many analytical studies that have been performed on Sceletium. More effort is thus required to fill this gap as the lack of reference compounds makes the identification and profiling of both minor and major alkaloids synthesised by S. tortuosum and its relatives more challenging.

        "text": "Historical ethnobotanical records allude to a practice of fermentation of S. tortuosum when it is used by local indigenous people but scientific evidence of the fermentation on phytochemicals of the plants remains in contention as current fermentation studies do not correlate with each other.  Studies investigating the manipulation of biosynthetic pathways in combination with fermentation studies may thus prove valuable in deepening the general understanding of the effects of the fermentation treatment(s) and its biological effects in animal systems. Despite this, the pharmacological tests, whether they be in in vitro and/or in vivo experiments, have increasingly supported the traditional use of S. tortuosum as a mood-elevator and anxiolytic agent. However, its antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects have been insufficiently investigated up until recently.  At this point, there has been some evidence that highlights the beneficial physiological effects of S. tortuosum extracts as a plant medicine which extend beyond its psychoactive effects, with potential therapeutic activity targeted at diabetes and obesity (Bennett and Smith, 2018). Interest in developing Sceletium into an additive for foods, beverages and supplements aiding in depressive and anxiolytic disorders has been happening for over a decade (Gericke and Viljoen, 2008), with some products finding the market. If this is to be fully realised, a fundamental field of investigation that will need to be looked into is the standardised cultivation of the plants for their phytochemicals. This can be achieved through the manipulation of secondary metabolites using physiological stress such as light, pH and nutrient stress in Sceletium species, which is currently a void in the research scope.
