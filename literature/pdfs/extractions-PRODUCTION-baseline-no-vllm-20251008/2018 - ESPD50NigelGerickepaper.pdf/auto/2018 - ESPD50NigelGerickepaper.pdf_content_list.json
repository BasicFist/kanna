Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe, a German-born physician and botanist who moved to Cape Town to practice as a physician, wrote a small book as a commentary to accompany the exhibited medicinal plants. In the entry for Sceletium tortuosum (as Mesembryanthemum tortuosum. Lin.), Pappe wrote, “This species, a native of the Karroo, appears to possess narcotic properties. The Hottentots, who know it by the name Kauw-goed, are in the habit of chewing it, and become intoxicated, while the farmers use it in the form of decoction or tincture, as a good sedative” (Pappe, 1868).

On inquiring if she had encountered possible psychoactive plants from Namaqualand, Fiona told me about a plant called kougoed, traditionally used by locals, and that when she had tried some it felt as if her perceptions of time and space had been altered. Fiona gave me a brown paper bag containing about 500g of stringy, brown, traditionally fermented and dried Sceletium. I chewed a few grams of the plant material, and after about fifteen minutes, the plant caused a rather sudden rush of euphoria. Over the following hour, this gradually changed to a feeling of deep calm that persisted for some four or five hours. Following from this intriguing initial experience, my wife Olga, myself and Fiona began a period of self-experimentation and gave samples of kanna to friends, fellow doctors and psychiatrists, anthropologists, botanists and an African traditional healer.

The focus of this field work was in the rural hamlets of Paulshoek and Nourivier in the Kamiesberg mountains of Namaqualand, not far from the 1685 trail of the Dutch expedition led by Simon van der Stel. Fieldwork was also undertaken in the vicinity of Kougoedvlakte (the area named after the once-abundant wild Sceletium tortuosum resource of this arid plain), and interviews and discussions were held with shepherds and goatherds in the western area of what is now the Riemvasmaak Community Conservancy. In rural hamlets, elderly male and female members of the local community, who had themselves used Sceletium for many decades, were interviewed. Three key informants, recognized by the communities for their specialist knowledge on medicinal plants, were selected for more detailed interviews: the renowned traditional healer Gert Dirkse or “Oom Gert” (meaning Uncle Gert) living near Paulshoek; a younger healer, Jap-Jap Klaase, living in Nourivier; and the shepherd Lodewyk Mories, living near the farm Ratelkraal situated between the towns Springbok and Pofadder.

Sceletium tortuosum is typically harvested by local people during the dry-season months from October through to January, when the plants have partly died back and become yellowish in colour. The plants are often found growing under woody shrubs, partially shaded and sheltered from the wind and from foraging by animals. The died-back yellowing plants are regarded as having more “power” than the vigorously growing green plants of the June to August winter rainy season. The plant is cut above the ground, leaving the roots and a small portion of stem behind to resprout. While some collectors gather the entire uprooted plant, older healers claim this is not following tradition and will prevent the plants from regenerating. The collected succulent plant material is crushed with a large stone on a flat rock and the resulting dripping wet fibrous pulp is put into a plastic bag. According to local people, traditional sheepskin bags were used in former times. The plastic bag is tied to exclude air, and the material is allowed to macerate in the hot sun for eight days with intermittent mixing. On the eighth or ninth day, the plant material is spread on a flat rock to dry in the sun, resulting in dry clumps of amorphous, light brown plant material with a characteristic musty “old socks” smell. This is the traditional kougoed or kanna of the Namaqualanders. ",

This work formed the basis for US Patent $^ { 6 , 2 8 8 , 1 0 4 }$ (Gericke and Van Wyk, 1999), which disclosed the use of mesembrine and related compounds, and extracts of Sceletium standardized to these compounds, as serotonin-uptake inhibitors (SRIs), and the use of these compounds in pharmaceutical formulations for the management of depression, anxiety, drug dependence, bulimia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Repeated treatment with SSRIs can upregulate PDE4 (Ye et al., 2000), which in turn reduces sensitivity to SSRIs in response to long-term treatment. The treatment with a dual SSRI and $\\mathtt { P D E } _ { 4 }$ inhibitors may thus have a therapeutic advantage (Cashman et al., 2009). Enzymes in the PDE4 family catalyze the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and have a critical role in controlling the intracellular concentration of cAMP and increasing phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein. PDE4s are found throughout the brain but their levels are decreased in depressed individuals not on medication, reflecting a downregulation of the cAMP cascade that can potentially be restored using PDE4 inhibitors. The prototypical PDE4 inhibitor Rolipram has been shown in both animal and clinical studies to have antidepressant activity (Terburg et al., 2013). ",

The client was able to be very insightful but lacked the capacity to process the insight in any meaningful way. She presented with an ongoing sense of emptiness and depersonalization, with a deep despondency and hopelessness. Sceletium was administered as a 50mg tablet daily from October 2000. Within ten days, the patient said that her mood had lifted and that she felt slightly less depersonalized. She was able to feel more focused, more engaged and not so socially “distant.” She doubled her dose to two 50-mg tablets daily just prior to her examination (November 2000) and described feeling less anxious and more able to cope with her usual examination anxiety. An interesting development on Sceletium was that she described feeling less inclined to overindulge in alcohol (she said that it didn’t taste as good). ",

The substances may be isolated natural compounds, synthetic or semi-synthetic compounds, extracts of plants or fungi, or whole or minimally processed plant or fungal material. The first online sales of Sceletium plant material, originally from 40kg of plant material cultivated by Grassroots Natural Products for Pharmacare Ltd., began in 1999 by Om-Chi Herbs in Eugene, Oregon in the USA, and by Conscious Dreams in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, later to be followed by Botanic Art in the Netherlands. These online stores played a major role in introducing kanna to a wide international audience. It is now eighteen years later, and there are many online Legal Highs and botanical supply stores selling fermented and unprocessed kanna as milled plant material and extracts. From about 2004, there seems to have been a marked increase in the use of kanna in the South African trance scene, where powdered kanna is used as a snuff, or mixed with marijuana for smoking to induce a “chilled” state of mind and to decrease anxiety in people who get more anxious while smoking marijuana. Kanna is used instead of MDMA by some people in the South African trance scene, and to reduce the come-down after an MDMA session by others. By 2017, kanna use had become part of the international trance and party scene, with use of kanna apparently being well known in Ibiza, Spain. ",

        "text": "A recent development of serious concern is the online sale of concentrated to highly concentrated extracts sold as kanna which are of uncertain botanical origin, unknown total alkaloid content, unknown relative alkaloid composition and unknown stability. A search of Sceletium extracts on Alibaba.com shows a wide variety of “Sceletium” extracts, many produced in China (some accompanied by photographs of flowers that are definitely not Sceletium flowers). This includes some touted as “100:1” extracts (presumably a raw material to extract ratio, weight/weight) and some purporting to be $9 8 \\%$ mesembrine” (Alibaba.com, 2017). There is already nascent legal and regulatory flagging of kanna, and overconcentrated extracts carry a potential for serious adverse events. The analysis of Sceletium alkaloids for future forensic toxicology and legislation purposes has already been described (Roscher et al., 2012), and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issued a list of 20 plant-based substances of concern in 2013, including Sceletium. The metabolism of Sceletium alkaloids was investigated in rat urine and pooled human liver preparations (Meyer et al., 2015) because of the increasing popularity of kanna as a legal high, and the metabolites, especially in the urine, would be good analytical targets for forensic and legal purposes. Sceletium has already attracted the attention of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) of the United States, featuring in a presentation by a forensic chemist at the DEA Special Testing and Research Laboratory with the title, “Novel Plant Hallucinogens and Plant-Derived Highs” (Dye, undated presentation). Surprisingly, Amazon.com has prohibited the sale of kanna and cited it as an example of a plant-derived product that simulates the effect of illegal drugs (Amazon.com, 2017). An additional legal and regulatory threat is the potential for adverse reactions from adulterated kanna. During an investigation into the wide phytochemical variability of kanna available from online stores, the alarming discovery was made that one of the samples of kanna had been adulterated with the stimulant ephedrine (Lesiak et al., 2016).

For the previous eight years, she had been on citalopram 20mg per day, which had adequately treated her depression and social anxiety. However, the patient found the side effects difficult to tolerate: loss of libido, emotional blunting and weight gain. Two attempts to discontinue citalopram resulted in recurrence of her depressive symptoms within four months, necessitating resumption of the medication. During consultation, the patient stated she was determined to wean herself off citalopram. After being counseled on pharmaceutical and botanical treatment options, the patient opted for a trial of 25mg extract of Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin®). Citalopram was reduced to 10mg daily for one week and then discontinued while starting 50mg of Sceletium, which was increased to a daily maintenance dose of 75mg. At one-month follow-up, she reported no anxiety/depressive symptoms, though she experienced occasional mild episodes of social anxiety, which she found easy to tolerate. Her libido had returned to normal, she felt much more in touch with her feelings and had lost two kilograms of weight. During the following month, her mood had slightly lowered, but this responded well to an increase of the Sceletium extract to 100mg per day. Eight months after initial assessment, she remained in remission on 100mg per day Sceletium extract Zembrin® with no side effects. ",
