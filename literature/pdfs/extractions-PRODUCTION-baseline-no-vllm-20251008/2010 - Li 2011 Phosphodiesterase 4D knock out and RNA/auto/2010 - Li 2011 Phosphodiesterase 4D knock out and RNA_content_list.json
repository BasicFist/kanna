        "text": "Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) plays an important role in mediating memory via the control of intracellular cAMP signaling; inhibition of PDE4 enhances memory. However, development of PDE4 inhibitors as memory enhancers has been hampered by their major side effect of emesis. PDE4 has four subtypes (PDE4A–D) consisting of 25 splice variants. Mice deficient in PDE4D displayed memory enhancement in radial arm maze, water maze, and object recognition tests. These effects were mimicked by repeated treatment with rolipram in wild-type mice. In addition, similarly as rolipram-treated wild-type mice, PDE4D-deficient mice also displayed increased hippocampal neurogenesis and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB). Furthermore, microinfusion of lentiviral vectors that contained microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting long-form PDE4D isoforms into bilateral dentate gyri of the mouse hippocampus downregulated PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, enhanced memory, and increased hippocampal neurogenesis and pCREB. Finally, while rolipram and PDE4D deficiency shortened $\\scriptstyle \\alpha 2$ adrenergic receptor-mediated anesthesia, a surrogate measure of emesis, miRNA-mediated PDE4D knock-down in the hippocampus did not. The present results suggest that PDE4D, in particular long-form PDE4D, plays a critical role in the mediation of memory and hippocampal neurogenesis, which are mediated by cAMP/CREB signaling; reduced expression of PDE4D, or at least PDE4D4 and PDE4D5, in the hippocampus enhances memory but appears not to cause emesis. These novel findings will aid in the development of PDE4 subtype- or variant-selective inhibitors for treatment of disorders involving impaired cognition, including Alzheimer’s disease. ",

        "text": "Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), an enzyme that catalyzes cAMP hydrolysis, plays an important role in the mediation of memory. Inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram, a selective PDE4 inhibitor, increases cAMP and phosphorylation of CREB (Schneider, 1984; Li et al., 2009), facilitates induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) (Barad et al., 1998), and enhances memory (Romano et al., 1996; Otmakhov et al., 2004). It also reverses memory deficits produced by pharmacological (Egawa et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2000, 2004), physical (Imanishi et al., 1997), or genetic approaches (Bourtchouladze et al., 2003). Consistent with this, PDE4 is involved in hippocampal neurogenesis, which is associated with learning and memory (Bruel-Jungerman et al., 2005; Epp et al., 2007). Chronic rolipram treatment increases proliferation and survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus; this is mediated by cAMP/cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB) signaling (Nakagawa et al., 2002a,b; Fujioka et al., 2004; Sasaki et al., 2007). Thus, PDE4 in the hippocampus is an important component of cellular signaling that mediates memory. ",

Their differential distributions in brain regions (Cherry and Davis, 1999; Perez-Torres et al., 2000) indicate distinct roles of individual PDE4 subtypes in CNS functions. Limited studies to date have shown that PDE4B is associated with schizophrenia (Millar et al., 2005) and anxiety (Zhang et al., 2008), whereas PDE4D is important for antidepressant activity (Zhang et al., 2002). While lacking clear demonstration, PDE4D appears to be the major subtype in mediating memory based on its predominant expression in hippocampal CA1 (Perez-Torres et al., 2000), its major role in cAMP hydrolysis (Zhang et al., 2002) and hippocampal LTP (Rutten et al., 2008), and on the finding that pharmacologically induced overexpression of PDE4D impairs memory (Giorgi et al., 2004). Unfortunately, development of PDE4 inhibitors for therapeutic purposes has been hindered by side effects such as emesis (Robichaud et al., 2001), which appears to be PDE4 subtype specific (Robichaud et al., 2002b).

        "text": "PDE4 variants are divided into four groups: long-form, shortform, super short-form, and dead-short form PDE4s. Long-form PDE4s are characterized by two unique, upstream conserved regions (UCR1 and UCR2) in the N terminus; short-form (PDE4B2, D1, and D2) and super short-form PDE4s (PDE4A1, B5, D6, and D10) lack the UCR1 or UCR1 plus a portion of UCR2, respectively; dead short-form PDE4s (such as inactive PDE4A7) (Johnston et al., 2004) lack both UCR1 and UCR2 (Houslay, 2001; O’Donnell and Zhang, 2004; Houslay et al., 2007; Lynex et al., 2008; Zhang, 2009). Long-form and the other PDE4 categories appear to be differentially expressed in brain regions (Perez-Torres et al., 2000; McPhee et al., 2001; Miro´ et al., 2002). Given that PDE4 variants are targeted to discrete signaling complexes (Houslay, 2010) and that knock-down of specific PDE4 variants using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) exhibits different cellular actions in vitro (Lynch et al., 2005; Kolosionek et al., 2009), it was of interest to know whether targeting long-form PDE4s, which are most important for cAMP hydrolysis (Baillie et al., 2000), altered memory.

Given the equivalent potency of rolipram for inhibition of all PDE4 subtypes/isoforms (MacKenzie and Houslay, 2000), rolipram $( 1 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m g / k g } )$ was coadministered with 4DmiR to determine the potential involvement of other PDE4 variants in memory.

First, selective PDE4D allosteric modulators not only reverse scopolamine-induced memory impairment but also enhance memory on their own in mice (Burgin et al., 2010). Second, hippocampal LTP is enhanced in PDE4Ddeficient mice, although amygdala-dependent, fear-conditioning memory is unexpectedly impaired (Rutten et al., 2008). Third, increased expression of PDE4D induced by high doses of PDE4 inhibitors impairs memory (Giorgi et al., 2004).

Consistent with this, chronic treatment with rolipram at a dose that increased pCREB and enhanced memory increased BrdUpositive cells in the dentate gyrus of WT mice 2 weeks after BrdU injections, at which time BrdU-labeled cells survived instead of proliferated (Schmidt and Duman, 2007). The neurogenic effect of rolipram was mimicked by PDE4D deficiency, which increased BrdU-positive cells (primarily survival) in the dentate gyrus to levels similar to those seen following chronic rolipram treatment. Given that rolipram did not alter the neurogenic effect of PDE4D deficiency and that mice deficient in PDE4B display only a slight increase in cell proliferation but not in survival of neurons (Zhang et al., 2008), PDE4D appears to be the major PDE4 subtype responsible for hippocampal neurogenesis.

Similarly, PDE4D deficiency also increased hippocampal Sox2, which was not altered by rolipram; it did not change the proportion of newborn neurons among BrdU-positive cells.

To overcome these, we used miRNAs, one of the RNAi techniques for gene silencing (Zeringue and Constantine-Paton, 2004; Cullen, 2005), to knock down the long-form PDE4Ds, given that long-form PDE4Ds are: (1) highly regulated by PKA and ERK and contain binding sites for protein-protein interactions (Houslay, 2010); (2) important for intracellular cAMP hydrolysis (Baillie et al., 2000); and (3) relatively highly expressed in the hippocampus (Miro et al., 2002; Richter et al., 2005). Gene silencing of PDE4 splice variants has been achieved in vitro by using siRNAs targeting a specific variant of PDE4B or PDE4D (Lynch et al., 2005; Li et al., 2006). While it is difficult to target individual PDE4D isoforms because of their high homologies, we designed a miRNA sequence to target nucleotides 642-662 of the PDE4D coding sequence, which corresponds to amino acids 214- 221 within the UCR1 domain of long-form PDE4D isoforms (Bolger et al., 1997). We used lentivirus as the vector for miRNAs given that lentiviral vector-mediated miRNAs produce stable, long-term, and neuron-specific gene suppression (Dull et al., 1998; Zufferey et al., 1998; Stegmeier et al., 2005; Schratt et al., 2006; Grillo et al., 2007), in contrast to synthetic siRNAs (Zentilin and Giacca, 2004). As indicated by EGFP, lentiviral miRNAs were well expressed in the GCL of the dentate gyrus; long-form PDE4D4 and PDE4D5 were selectively downregulated in the hippocampus, leading to increases in hippocampal neurogenesis and pCREB levels and enhancement of memory. While the other long-form PDE4Ds (i.e., PDE4D7-9, 11) were not examined because of the lack of specific antibodies, the results suggest that at least the PDE4D4/5 variants are importantly involved in these processes. Further studies using similar gene silencing techniques are required to determine the role of other long-form PDE4Ds and variants of other PDE4 subtypes, in particular PDE4A5 and PDE4A10, that are highly expressed in the hippocampus (McPhee et al., 2001; D’Sa et al., 2005) in memory.

Regardless, the effects of rolipram on memory, pCREB, and neurogenesis did not differ from those of combined rolipram and PDE4D-miRNAs, supporting an important role for PDE4D4 and PDE4D5 in these processes. Again, the role of other PDE4 variants such as PDE4A5 and PDE4A10 cannot be excluded given that they are highly expressed in the hippocampus (McPhee et al. 2001; D’Sa et al., 2005). Other long-form PDE4Ds may also contribute to the effects of 4DmiR. Further studies are required to clarify these issues. ",

In contrast, rolipram treatment or PDE4D deficiency decreased the duration of anesthesia; this is consistent with the contribution of PDE4 and, more specifically, PDE4D to emesis, the major side effect of PDE4 inhibitors (Dyke and Montana, 2002; Robichaud et al., 2001, 2002a,b).

        "text": "In summary, using behavioral, neurochemical, immunohistochemical, and molecular biological approaches, we demonstrated for the first time the roles of PDE4D and its long-form isoforms in cAMP/CREB signaling-mediated memory and neurogenesis. Manipulations targeting long-form PDE4Ds in the hippocampus may alter cAMP/CREB signaling in a manner that affects memory and hippocampal neurogenesis but avoids emesis. These are supported by the findings that selective PDE4D allosteric modulators incompletely inhibit PDE4 activity and enhance memory but have reduced potential to cause emesis (Burgin et al., 2010). Our results may be beneficial for treatment of memory loss associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. ",
