The plants’ mesembrine-type alkaloids are potential therapeutics for a plethora of psychological, neurological and inflammatory disorders. In our in vitro and ex vivo studies, vegetative propagation and growth of this species were investigated. Cytokinin (CK) profiles were also explored. Shoot multiplication was induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with $2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). In vitro-generated shoots were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with 0, 2.5, 5.0 and $1 0 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ IBA or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Optimal rooting $( 5 5 \\% )$ , mean number of roots $( 3 . 8 0 \\pm 0 . 8 3 ) \\$ and new leaf pairs $( 4 . 6 5 \\pm 0 . 6 7 )$ were achieved by $1 0 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ IBA. After greenhouse acclimatization, $45 \\mathrm { - } 9 0 \\%$ of plantlets survived. All ex vivo shoot cuttings rooted well $( 9 0 - 1 0 0 \\%$ . The highest mean number of roots $( 1 1 . 2 0 \\pm 1 . 3 7 ) \\$ and root length $\\langle 5 7 . 1 8 \\pm 3 . 8 5 \\mathrm { m m } \\rangle$ were obtained by $5 . 0 \\mu \\mathrm { M }$ IBA. Although spontaneous rooting was observed in both experiments, auxins enhanced multiple growth parameters. Cytokinin analyses of tissue-cultured (auxin-treated) and greenhouse (untreated) plants revealed higher cytokinin levels in vitro. These investigations provide rapid and efficient propagation techniques for Sceletium tortuosum which will be valuable to conservationists and pharmaceutical companies. ",

However, it is most-exploited for its mood-enhancing and calming properties (Digby 2005; Laidler 1928; Rood 1994; Thunberg 1795). The mesembrine-type alkaloids responsible for these effects are suitable treatments for anxiety, stress and depression (Elev8™ 2017; Gericke and Van Wyk 2001; Harvey et al. 2011; Murbach et al. 2014; Terburg et al. 2013). They are also recognized as promising therapeutics for neurodegenerative, psychological and inflammatory disorders, ranging from Alzheimer’s disease and drug dependencies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Bennett et al. 2018; Coetzee et al. 2016; Dimpfel et al. 2018; Kapewangolo et al. 2016; Napoletano et al. 2001).

Non-aseptic techniques such as grafting, budding, layering and cuttings are common and involve the use of plant organs only (LeBude and Blazich 2018). However, through aseptic plant tissue culture, somatic cells, tissues and organs can be utilized (George et al. 2008; Skoog and Miller 1957).

The CK analysis revealed the total CK pool to be three-fold higher in tissue cultured plantlets as compared to in situ plants (Table 1). Aromatic CKs were responsible for $7 4 . 7 \\%$ of the in  vitro CK pool, while isoprenoid and aromatic CK pools were approximately equal in situ. Active free CK bases (cis-zeatin $( c Z )$ , trans-zeatin $( t Z )$ and $\\mathrm { N } ^ { 6 }$ -isopentenyladenine (iP)) resulted in a larger pool in situ $( 3 5 . 6 0 \\ \\mathrm { p m o l / g } )$ than in vitro $( 2 7 . 0 3 \\ \\mathrm { p m o l / g } )$ . In both samples, para-topolin $( p \\mathbf { T } )$ represented the most abundant free CK base $( 5 4 7 . 3 3 \\pm 1 8 3 . 9 5 \\$ and $6 3 6 . 8 6 \\pm 1 3 2 . 4 4 \\mathrm { p m o l / g }$ for in situ and in vitro shoots, respectively). The four 7-glucosides present in situ were more prevalent in vitro (tZ7G, iP7G, DHZ7G and $p \\mathrm { T } 7 \\mathrm { G }$ ), with the most substantial increase observed for $p \\mathrm { T } 7 \\mathrm { G }$ (from $5 6 . 0 5 { \\scriptstyle \\pm 0 . 7 1 } ~ \\mathrm { p m o l / g }$ in  situ to $1 8 2 6 . 0 9 { \\scriptstyle \\pm 6 9 . 1 6 ~ \\mathrm { p m o l / g } }$ in vitro). The in vitro sample also contained an additional 7-glucoside $( c Z 7 \\mathrm { G } )$ that was not detected in situ. Dihydrozeatin-9-glucoside (DHZ9G) was the only 9-glucoside detected in situ (DHZ9G), but it was more abundant in vitro $( 3 2 . 2 3 \\pm 2 . 6 9 )$ . Additionally, mT9G was detected in vitro $( 4 8 4 . 7 1 \\pm 4 6 . 7 6 \\mathrm { p m o l / g } )$ , but not at all in situ (Table 1). ",

However, N-glucosylation can prevent the action of CK oxidase altogether (Kieber and Schaller 2014; Werner et al. 2006). Hence, N-glucosylation may have been triggered to convert CKs to conjugates that can release free CK bases (Hoyerová and Hošek 2020).

Despite high levels of this and other inactive CK conjugates, the active free base CK pools of both samples were similar in size (Table 1).

N-glucosylation is a method of inactivating active CKs to achieve said regulation.

Following this logic, plantlets had never before experienced an exogenous supply of IAA and may have begun acclimating to this during the experiment. During this process, signalling for the storage of some IAA, as well as for root proliferation would have been ongoing (Korasick et al. 2013; Ljung et al. 2005; Normanly et al. 2010; Overvoorde et al. 2010).

Nevertheless, an exogenous auxin supply was able to enhance rooting parameters (Fig. 5). This is supported by Haissig (1974), who stated that auxins are able to enhance root proliferation even in cuttings that root easily. Indole-3-butyric acid was the better auxin for rooting cuttings of S. tortuosum, in terms of MNR and MRL (Fig. 5). Kesari et al.
