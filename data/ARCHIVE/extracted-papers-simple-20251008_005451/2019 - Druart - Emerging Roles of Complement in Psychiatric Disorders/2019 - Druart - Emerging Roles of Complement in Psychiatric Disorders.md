The complement system consists of more than 30 proteins that have long been known
to participate to the immune defence against pathogens and to the removal of damaged
cells. Their role, however, extends beyond immunity and clearance of altered “self”
components in the periphery. In particular, complement proteins can be induced by all
cell types in the brain. Recent discoveries highlight the role of complement in normal and
pathological brain development. Specifically, the complement system mediates synaptic
pruning, a developmental process whereby supernumerary synapses are eliminated
in the immature brain. The complement system has been implicated in pathological
synapse elimination in schizophrenia, West Nile virus infection, and lupus, all of which
are associated with psychiatric manifestations. Complement also contributes to synapse
loss in neurodegenerative conditions. This review provides a brief overview of the well-
studied role of complement molecules in immunity. The contribution of complement to

FIGURE 1 | The complement pathways. There are three distinct activation pathways in the complement system: the classical and lectin pathway that are activated
by pathogens or damaged cells, and the alternative pathway that is activated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3. All lead to the sequential recruitment of
complement components to form a C3 convertase (C4bC2b or C3bBb). The C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The C3b fragment binds to the surface
of antigens, targeting them for opsonization (phagocytosis). C3b also induces a positive-feedback loop (“amplification loop”) leading to the generation of additional
C3 convertase. C3b can also be recruited to become part of the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. The short C3a and C5a fragments, also
known as anaphylatoxins, foster immune responses and inflammation. C5b initiates the assembly of C6, 7, 8, and 9 into the membrane attack complex, which
forms a membrane pore resulting in the lysis of the pathogen.
