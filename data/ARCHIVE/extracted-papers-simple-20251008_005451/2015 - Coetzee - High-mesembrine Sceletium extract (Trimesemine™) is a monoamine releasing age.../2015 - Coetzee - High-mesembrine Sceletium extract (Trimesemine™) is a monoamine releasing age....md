High-mesembrine Sceletium extract (Trimesemine™) is a monoamine
releasing agent, rather than only a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor

Whilebothmonoaminereleasingagents(MRAs)andselective
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may alleviate depression,
other symptoms associated with consumption, such as risk for
toxicity and/or addiction, differ substantially between the two.
Given the significant and detrimental side-effects reported for
other medicinal plants when used outside of its original in-
digenous knowledge context, e.g. in the case of Hoodia gordonii
(Blom et al., 2011; Smith and Krygsman, 2014a, 2014b) and Su-
therlandia frutescens (Africa and Smith, 2015), it is important to
fully understand how these compounds may affect human phy-
siology,beforemarketingthesecompoundsasnaturalmedicine.
Therefore,the aim of this study was toinvestigatethe neuro-

Centre for Statistical Consultation, Stellenbosch University) using
Statistica v.11 (StatSoft Software). Effects were assessed using
Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA and Fischer LSD post hoc
testing.Inaddition,Levene'stestforhomogeneityofvarianceswas

Whenconsideringvesicularmonoaminetransporter-2(VMAT-
2) expression, citalopram did not have any effect on this trans-
porter in astrocytes (Fig. 4a), but resulted in a sustained up-reg-
ulation of VMAT-2 in GT1-7 cells (Fig. 4b). In comparison, higher
dosesofTRIresultedinanup-regulationofVMAT-2inastrocytes,
with 1ml/ml TRI resulting in a significantly higher VMAT-2 ex-

in GT1-7 cells, TRI showed a significant dose-dependent up-reg-
ulation of VMAT-2 from control at both 15 and 30min (Fig. 4b).
This increase was also more pronounced than the effect of cita-
lopram, although it did not quite reach statistical significance
(P¼0.09). Representative images of fluorescence typically ob-
served are again presented in supplementary material (Supple-
