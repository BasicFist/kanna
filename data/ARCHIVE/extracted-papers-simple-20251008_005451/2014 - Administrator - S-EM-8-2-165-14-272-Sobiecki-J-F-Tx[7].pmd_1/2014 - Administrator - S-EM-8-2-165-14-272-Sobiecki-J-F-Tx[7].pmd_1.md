KEYWORDS Psychotropic Plants. Traditional Medicine. South African Medicinal Plants. Ethnobotany. Mental
Illness
ABSTRACT Psychoactive plant research has been actively pursued over the last century around the world,
particularly in the Americas. Yet, southern Africa has often been regarded to have relatively few psychoactive
plant species of cultural importance with little research conducted on the region’s potential psychoactive flora.
However, in the last decade, renewed interest has occurred in the study of psychoactive plants from southern
Africa. Recent anthropological studies have demonstrated the significance of psychoactive plant medicines in the
initiation process of southern African traditional healers and in treating mental illness, while numerous
ethnopharmacological studies have screened southern African plants for psychotropic activity, with promising
new findings and research directions resulting. Yet, despite this great progress, the indigenous cultural (ritual) uses
of psychoactive plants by the indigenous people of southern Africa remains a neglected area of ethnobotanical
research. Aspects identified as requiring further study include: the indigenous cultural understandings of mental
illness and psychoactive plants, the role of psychoactive plants in the spiritual practices of southern African
traditional healers, the influence of various psychoactive plant species used in traditional formulas and the folklore
and mythology relating to indigenous psychoactive plants. Thus, much is still to be learnt and documented from
the southern African traditional healers regarding their worldview and their botanical, diagnostic, methodological
and healing knowledge that can provide insights into the treatment of mental illness and the actions of psychoactive
plants.
