Chapter
The Importance of Sceletium
tortuosum (L.) N.E. Brown and Its
Viability as a Traditional African
Medicinal Plant
Richard James Faber, Charles Petrus Laubscher
and Muhali Olaide Jimoh
Abstract
Sceletium tortuosum is a succulent plant that belongs to the family
Mesembryanthemaceae (Aizoaceae). It is indigenous to South Africa, where it is
well known by the indigenous people, especially in Namaqualand where the plant is
utilized regularly for its medicinal and psycho-active properties. The main alkaloids
responsible for these properties are mesembrine, mesembrenine (mesembrenone),
and mesembrenol. The potential of the plant to be an alternative supplement in the
promotion of health and treating a variety of psychological and psychiatric disor-
ders such as depression and anxiety has stimulated interest in its pharmacological
property and possibility of its commercialization. The economic value of indig-
enous medicinal plants in South Africa is approximately US$60 000 000 or R4 000
000 000 annually. Thus, interest in the knowledge and use of Traditional African
Medicinal Plants (TAMP) as well as meeting pharmacological and economic
needs of ever-increasing human population has led to the commercialization of
traditional African medicines at a fast rate. It was found that S. tortuosum has clear
pharmaceutical and economical importance and is one of the only known plants
to contain the alkaloids mesembrenone and mesembrine which can be utilized for
the promotion of health and/or treating a variety of psychological disorders such as
anxiety and depression.
Keywords: African medicine, Aizoaceae, alkaloids, hydroponics, mesembrine,

1. Introduction
Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E. Br. and Sceletium expansum L. Bolus (formerly
known as Mesembryanthemum tortuosum L. and Mesembryanthemum expansum L.)
forms part of the succulent group of plants within the Mesembryanthemaceae
family (Figure 1). The common names given to Sceletium are kanna and kougoed.
However, some may argue that the name kougoed refers to the finished traditional
preparation made by drying and fermenting the harvested plant material, which

increases its stimulating effect. The plant is native to South Africa, where it is well
known by the indigenous people, especially in Namaqualand, where the plant is
utilized regularly for its medicinal and anti-depressant properties [2].
According to Schultes [3] and Harvey et al. [4] the main substances responsible
for these properties are the alkaloids mesembrine, mesembrenine (mesembre-
none), and mesembrenol. Interest in S. tortuosum has been growing for its potential
to be an alternative supplement in the promotion of health and treating a variety of
psychological and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety [5]. Studies
on the chemistry and biological activity on Traditional African Medicinal Plants
(TAMP) have only recently (1997–2008) been published, despite TAMP having
been reported as one of the oldest medicinal systems in various ethnobotanical
reports [6, 7].
Soilless culture systems (SCS’s) in controlled greenhouse environments have
proven to be the most effective strategy for agricultural production by providing
flexibility as well as control. Crops can be produced in and out of season, while
water and soilless media can easily be monitored for its total nutrient status. For
these reasons SCS’s within a greenhouse environment provide for high quality
products and high yields, even in places where environmental conditions would not
usually permit [8].
Relevant natural compounds, mainly secondary metabolite concentration and
composition, determine the quality of medicinal plants. However, water avail-
ability, light intensity and temperature are examples of various environmental
conditions which affect the quality and quantity of such secondary metabolites
[9]. Hence, investigating the effect of different soilless growing media and fertiga-
tion regimes on the vegetative growth and alkaloid concentration of S. tortuosum
will contribute to developing optimal growing protocols for cultivating high
quality medicinal plants in hydroponics for the ethno-pharmaceutical industry.
The aim of this chapter was therefore, to highlight pharmaceutical and economic
viability of S. tortuosum and relate the medicinal value of the plant with respect to
the bioactive compound found in it and suggest ways of cultivating the plant in a
soilless systems.

2. Mesembryanthemaceae FENZL: a sub family of Aizoaceae
Within the family Aizoaceae Martinov. there are currently four sub-families,
namely Sesuvioideae, Aizooideae, Ruschioideae, and Mesembryanthemoideae
[10, 11]. Succulent plants within the Aizoaceae family are popularly termed
“Mesembs”, and sometimes placed in their own family, the Mesembryanthemaceae
[2]. Common terms used to describe this group of succulent plants are vygies,
fig-marigolds, flowering-stones, ice plants and, midday flowers, among others.
These plants fascinate many plant enthusiasts and have become popular collector’s
items due to their remarkable variation in leaf architecture, flower color and form,
and fruit structure (Figure 2). Different genera within the family grow in various
habitats, and examples can thus be found growing in rocky crevices, silty flats and
in saline wastelands. Mesembs occur mainly in south-western Africa, including
Angola, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia [2, 12] (Figure 3).

This family has received a large amount of attention in the present century both
in herbaria collections and in the field. There are several reasons why the family is
important in the ecosystems where they occur: they stabilize soil, which prevents ero-
sion; various insects are catered for year-round by their blossoms, while some leaves
serve as fodder for livestock. Apart from its ecological importance, this group of
plants also has ethnobotanical value, and is used in making soap, poultices, preserves
and also in some cases can serve as a type of psycho-active stimulant [2] (Figure 2).
Sceletium
3. The genus (L.) N.E. BR.
S. tortuosum (L.) N.E. Br. and S. expansum L. Bolus (formerly known as
Mesembryanthemum tortuosum L. and Mesembryanthemum expansum L.) forms part
of the succulent group of plants within the Mesembryanthemaceae family. The
name Sceletium is derived from the Latin word sceletus, or skeleton in English, due
to the noticeable leaf veins resembling skeleton-like structures within dried leaves
of the plants. Sceletium spp. are easily identified by this skeletonised structure of
the leaves [2, 10]. The common names given to Sceletium are kanna and kougoed.
However some may argue that the name kougoed refers to the finished traditional
preparation made by drying and fermenting the harvested plant material, which
increases its psychoactive effect [2, 14] (Figure 4).
Strong evidence suggest that the indigenous people of southern Africa used one
or both Sceletium species as a vision-inducing narcotic. However, the hallucinogenic
effect of kanna/kougoed could have been confused with other intoxicating plants
such as Cannabis spp. or Sclerocarya spp. as the narcotic use of the plant was never
observed directly. Despite this, alkaloids possessing sedative, cocaine-like effects
have been found within both of these species of Sceletium [3]. Other known species
of Sceletium include the following: S. crassicaule L. Bolus, S. exalatum Gerbaulet,
S. expansum L. Bolus, S. rigidum L. Bolus, S. strictum L. Bolus, and S. varians (Haw.)
Gerbaulet [2, 10].

S. tortuosum is now considered a medicinal crop plant and is classified as
mind-altering, sedative, euphoric, and not hallucinogenic [14, 15]. The alkaloids
responsible for these psychoactive properties are mesembrine and mesembre-
none. However, the concentration of alkaloids within individual plants may vary
depending on their chemotype. Uses of the plant include the treatment of anxiety,
stress, nervous tension, alcohol addiction, colic in infants and for suppressing
hunger and thirst (Figure 5). With clear ethno-pharmaceutical value it is also
worthy to mention that the use of S. tortuosum develops no physical or psychologi-
cal dependency [15].
4. Relevance of traditional African medicinal plants
Interest in the knowledge and use of Traditional African Medicinal Plants
(TAMP) as well as an ever-increasing human population has led to the commercial-
ization of traditional African medicines at a fast rate [16]. As stated in Keirungi and
Fabricius [17], the economic value of indigenous medicinal plants in South Africa is
approximately US$60 000 000 or R4 000 000 000 annually. The number of people
in South Africa that depend on TAMP to aid their medical needs is estimated at 27
million [18]. The majority of plants used for traditional medicine are harvested
from the wild except for some which are selected and cultivated by traditional
healers [19].
In 1998 it was estimated that 20 000 tonnes of plant material were being traded
in South African markets [20]. Seven hundred thousand tonnes of plant material
have been extracted from the wild for this market which mostly consist of people
with disadvantaged socio-economic situations or backgrounds [21]. As stated in
Makunga et al. [21], US$ 50–100 million in the form of approximately 1000 plant
species are being exchanged in this informal sector.

5. Secondary metabolites and alkaloids
Plant secondary metabolites are divided into three categories, namely terpenoids,
flavonoids, and alkaloids. Consisting of multiple chemical structures and biological
activities, secondary metabolites are an extremely wealthy source of compounds and
are utilized in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic and fine chemical industries.
Examples of familiar natural plant products that are used as drugs and/or dietary
supplements are: artemisinin, paclitaxel, ginsenoside, lycopene, and resveratrol
[22]. Secondary metabolites play a major role in plants’ adaptation to their environ-
ment and are thought to be responsible for antimicrobial and anti-viral activities
exhibited by plants [23, 24]. Apart from protecting plants against leaf damage
instigated by the incident light intensity via ultra-violet trapping mechanisms, they
cause allelopathy, antipathogens and antifeeding mechanisms in plants [25–27].
Alkaloids are potent secondary metabolites that consist of one or several
nitrogen (N) atoms in their molecular structure. There are approximately 20
000 alkaloid structures that have been described and are classified according
to their molecular ring (heterocyclic) structure. There are different types of
mesembrine alkaloids in Sceletium species. Among these are; (3aS,7aS)-3a-(3,4-
dimethoxyphenyl)-1-methylhexahydro-1H-indol-6(2H)-one; (3aR,7aS)-3a-(3,4-
dimethoxyphenyl)-1-methyl-3,3a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-indol-6(2H)-one; (3aS,6
− −
R,7aS) 3a-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) 1-methyloctahydro-1H-indol-6-ol; and
(3aR,6S,7aS)-3a-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-methyl-2,3,3a,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-
indol-6-ol [28, 29]. These groups are indole, isoquinoline, quinolone, tropane,
pyrrolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids. Some alkaloids are neurotoxins and/or
mind-altering substances. Most have pharmacological or toxicological relevance,
and many isolated alkaloids serve as therapeutic agents in medicine [16]. Alkaloids
confer several biological effects on plants such as stimulants (caffeine and ephed-
rine), antitussive (codeine), pain killer (morphine), anti-malarial (quinine), aph-
rodisiac (yohimbine), phosphodiesterase inhibitor (papaverine), antiarrhythmic
(ajmaline), anti-gouty arthritis (colchicines), anti-rheumatic pains (capsaicin),
antiglaucoma (pilocarpine) and anti-psoriasis berberine [30–32].
Like section Ganymedes (Narcissus pallidulus and Narcissus triandrus) within
Amaryllidaceae family, Sceletium is one of the few plant genera containing mesem-
brine alkaloids [33, 34]. According to Krstenansky [29], not all Sceletium species
have been reported to contain mesembrine alkaloids. While species like S. tortuo-
sum, S. anatomicum, S. crassicaule, S. expansum, S. namaquense and S. strictum have
been reported to contain mesembrinated, the status of S. archeri, S. emarcidum,
S. exalatum, S. joubertii, S. rigidum, S. varians and S. subvelutinum in terms of
mesembrine alkaloids is not yet confirmed [29, 35].
6. Soilless culture
Soilless culture, also known as hydroponics and/or hydroculture is the term that
is used when methods of growing plants without soil is utilized. Artificial or soil-
less substrate may or may not be used to provide structural support for the plants
depending on the grower and method used [36].
Ecological imbalances such as extreme temperatures, chemical toxicity and
oxidative stress are threatening conventional agricultural practices. With an annual
rise in population and consumers becoming more aware of the quality, quantity
and nutritious value of products consumed, challenges within agricultural systems
to keep up with demands and standards are becoming more complex. The need for
more efficient and controlled cultivation methods have risen dramatically. Soilless

culture systems have been proved to be one of the most efficient and effective
cultivation method in the agriculture industry of today [8].
7. Electrical conductivity and nutrients
Serving as indicators for soil fertility, nutrient concentrations within soil have
been of interest for decades. Nutrients can be organic or inorganic. Availability,
utilization, translocation and absorption of nutrients by crop plants for growth
and development are referred to as mineral nutrition. Plants require a variety of
nutrients in order to successfully grow and develop to their full potential. The most
important mineral nutrients are the macro nutrients, namely nitrogen, phos-
phorous and potassium, although plants also require micro-nutrients in smaller
amounts which can be argued to be equally important [37].
Plants require nitrogen (N) in the largest quantities compared to other elements.
N serves as a constituent for many plant cell components such as, amino acids,
proteins and nucleic acids. When there is a lack of N availability to a plant, the
plants growth will be inhibited rapidly, followed by the common characteristic
symptom, chlorosis in older leaves [38, 39]. Phosphorous (P) serves as an integral
component of valuable compounds found in plant cells. These include phospho-
lipids as well as sugar-phosphate intermediates of respiration and photosynthesis.
Necrotic spots, dark-green colouration of leaves, which could also become mal-
formed, as well as rapid malfunctioning of photosynthetic apparatus and stunted
growth are common characteristic symptoms of P deficiency [39, 40].
Furthermore, various enzymes that are important in respiration and photosyn-
thesis are activated by potassium (K). The osmotic potential of plant cells are also
partly regulated by K. Marginal chlorosis of leaves, which further develops into
necrosis of leaf tips or margins and in between veins is the most common symptom
of K deficiency in plants [39, 41]. Likewise, cell wall synthesis and mitotic cell divi-
sion depend on the availability of calcium (Ca) ions. Normal functioning of plant
membranes and various plant responses to environmental and hormonal signals
require Ca. Necrosis of young meristematic regions where cell division and cell
wall formation is most prominent is a characteristic symptom of Ca deficiency
[39, 42]. Also, cystine, cysteine, and methionine are amino acids in which sulfur
(S) is found. Sulfur is also a constituent of a number of co-enzymes and vitamins,
namely coenzyme A, S-adenosylmethionine, biotin, Vitamin B1 and pantothenic
acid, which are all essential for optimal metabolism in plant cells [39, 43].
Electrical conductivity (EC) is the measurement used to indicate the total
concentration of nutrients within an aqueous solution. High EC indicates a high
concentration of nutrients within the solution, while a low EC indicates a low con-
centration of nutrients [44]. When plants are supplied with a high EC nutrient solu-
tion, the nutrient concentration within the leaves will not necessarily be higher than
in plants supplied with a low EC nutrient solution [45], suggesting that the nutrient
uptake in plants is not necessarily based on the amount of nutrients available.
8. Water amounts
Production of plants in the modern sense requires advancements in technology
that will allow the optimization of cultivating high quality plant material while
minimizing the use of natural resources, such as water [46]. This is also true for the
growing of medicinal and aromatic plants, as well as plant production in general [47].
South African agriculture faces increasing pressure to use water more efficiently,
as the industry must oblige to demonstrate efficient and effective water use due to
7

## Page 9

limited valuable natural resources [48]. The role of irrigated farming in the livelihood
of a nation cannot be underscored. In South Africa in particular, agricultural sector
uses the highest volume of water compared to other sectors. To increase the amount of
water needed in other critical sector of the economy, there is the need to improve on
water use efficiency during irrigation through reduced water consumption without
compromising yield. Regrettably, the concept of irrigation efficiency is often misinter-
preted leading to the general belief that water just evaporates with minimal irrigation
efficiencies and re-emerges with significant progress in agricultural productivity [49].
This necessitated the emergence of the South African water management framework
which oversees holistically, the water source, the irrigation farm, bulk conveyance
system and the irrigation scheme to ensure water balance across all sectors [49].
It has been observed that a considerably higher concentration of secondary
metabolites are produced in medicinal or spice plants grown under water deficient
conditions, compared to identical plants of the same species grown with ample
amounts of water [50]. Although changes in the synthesis of desired natural com-
pounds is clear when drought stress is applied to plants, the overall effect of apply-
ing drought stress for optimizing specific secondary metabolites in plants remains
complex. The amount of water also influences other relevant factors such as plant
biomass yield and rate of growth. Depending on the plant and the growers’ desired
outcome with regards to quality, quantity, and rate of growth, the amount of water
applied should be carefully considered as there is no prevalent recommendation
that can be made for all plants. By deliberately applying drought-stress without first
thoroughly investigating how different plants react to different amounts of water
and the method of applying it could yield undesirable results [51].
9. Conclusion
Sceletium tortuosum is indigenous to South Africa. It is one of the very few plants
known to contain highly sought after mesembrine alkaloids. Its potential as an alter-
native supplement in the promotion of health and treating a variety of psychologi-
cal and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety has stimulated interest
in its pharmacological property and possibility of its commercialization. Therefore,
meeting pharmacological and economic needs of ever-increasing human popula-
tion necessitates the use of efficient systems such as hydroponics which require
minimum use of land and environmental factors can be maximally controlled to
cultivate the plant for optimal yield.
