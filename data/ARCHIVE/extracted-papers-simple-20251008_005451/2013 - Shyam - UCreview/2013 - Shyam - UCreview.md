Abstract
Currently available treatment options for ulcerative colitis (UC) in modern medicine have several adverse effects.
Therefore, there is a need to develop safe and effective treatment modalities for ulcerative colitis (UC). Traditional and
alternative medicine play an important role in the management of UC as they were developed from the experience of
people which passed from one generation to next since history of civilisation. This article presents a review on some
reported traditional and alternative medicine for UC.
Key words: Ulcerative colitis, Inflammatory bowel disease, Colitis, Colon, Inflammation, Traditional medicine, Herbal
medicine etc.
