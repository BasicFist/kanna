the resilience of African indigenous healthcare, despite the evolution and operationalisation of
western medical systems in Africa.
Consistent with the above understanding, Moshabela, Zuma and Gaede (2016) assert that
indigenous health practices in South Africa remain functional in indigenous communities,
although unrecognised. Following this lack of recognition and support by means of policies,
Africans have had to adopt western healthcare systems. However, Salamonsen and Ahlzén (2018),
Malokoane et al. (2020) and Rispel (2016) argue that a wide range of states across the world have
adopted and implemented western health systems with ineffective outcomes and increasing
levels of patient distrust. These authors further contend that many western health systems in
