Complementary and to evaluate the acute antidepressant-like properties of Zembrin® versus the reference antidepressant, esci-
adjunctive medicine talopram, in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat, a genetic rodent model of depression.
FSL rat Materials and methods: The chemical profile of Zembrin® was determined by ultra-performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) chromatogram method using alkaloid standards. Twelve saline
treated FSL and six Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) control rats were used to confirm face validity of the FSL model
=
using the forced swim test (FST). Thereafter, FSL rats (n 10) received either 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg of
Zembrin®, or 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg escitalopram oxalate (ESC), both via oral gavage, and subjected to the open field
test (OFT) and FST.
Results: Four main ST alkaloids were identified and quantified in Zembrin® viz. mesembrenone, mesembrenol,
mesembrine, and mesembranol (47.9%, 32%, 13.2%, and 6.8% of the total alkaloids, respectively). FSL rats
showed significantly decreased swimming and climbing (coping) behaviours, and significantly increased
immobility (despair), versus FRL controls. ESC 5 mg/kg and Zembrin® 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg showed sig-
nificant dose-dependent reversal of immobility in FSL rats and variable effects on coping behaviours. Zembrin®
50 mg/kg was the most effective antidepressant dose, showing equivalence to ESC 5.
Conclusions: Zembrin® (25 and 50 mg/kg) and ESC (5 mg/kg) are effective antidepressants after acute treatment
in the FST, as assessed in FSL rats. Moreover, Zembrin® 50 mg/kg proved equivalent to ESC 5. Further long-term
bio-behavioural studies on the antidepressant properties of Zembrin® are warranted.
