Rosettes showing the narrow-leaf syndrome were
found to intercept and conduct larger amounts of fog
towards their bases (F = 23.25, P = 0.0002).
Comparative analysis of rosette morphologies
The first form index extracted by the PCA on the
species · morphological traits matrix explained 35.7%
of the total variation. All other axes were non-signifi-
cant. It is apparent from the signs of the loadings
(Table 3) that high positive values in the index corre-
spond to plants with long, narrow leaves, while low
values correspond to plants with wide, thick, fleshy
leaves. Other traits that led plants to score high along
the PCA axis were longer caudices, many leaves, no
ornaments that increase the boundary layer thickness
and complex (aerodynamically rough) leaf distribu-
tions as measured by the Fibonacci number. Thus, the
multivariate axis corresponds largely to the narrow-
leaf syndrome (Fig. 5).
The mean form composition of the rosette commu-
nity at Tehuaca´n increased with altitude, indicating
that slender-leafed rosettes are dominant at higher
elevations (F = 16.9, P = 0.0005). A significant non-
linear term was found (F = 11.94, P = 0.0024), but the
