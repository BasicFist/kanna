Biopiracy: Crying wolf or a lever for equity and conservation?

explain this apparent contradiction. The cases reveal that while ABS has succeeded in recognizing holders of
traditional knowledge, the wider political and economic struggles faced by communities remain neglected.
Power relations and economic disparities have not changed, and control remains vested in land, with ownership
remaining highly skewed towards industry partners who have market dominance; and intellectual property, the
benefits of which are disassociated from traditional knowledge holders and biodiversity custodians. ABS pro-
cesses have also led to a clamor for representation, favoring groups that are politically connected, well organized
and resourced, while excluding more marginalized groups who are less capacitated. Moreover, despite significant
biodiversity concerns in each case, there are few conservation benefits. Such trends, combined with new forms of

digital biopiracy and opportunities opening through the post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, emphasize
the need to reconceptualize ABS to leverage more equitable and sustainable outcomes.
