Abstract
Background—Long-term exposure to drugs of abuse causes an up-regulation of the cAMP-
signaling pathway in the nucleus accumbens and other forebrain regions, this common
neuroadaptation is thought to underlie aspects of drug tolerance and dependence.
Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is an enzyme that the selective hydrolyzes intracellular cAMP. It is
expressed in several brain regions that regulate the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse.
Objective—Here, we review the current knowledge about central nervous system (CNS)
distribution of PDE4 isoforms and the effects of systemic and brain-region specific inhibition of
PDE4 on behavioral models of drug addiction.
Methods—A systematic literature search was performed using the Pubmed.
Results—Using behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference and drug self-
administration as behavioral models, a large number of studies have shown that local or systemic
administration of PDE4 inhibitors reduce drug intake and/or drug seeking for psychostimulants,
alcohol, and opioids in rats or mice.
Conclusions—Preclinical studies suggest that PDE4 could be a therapeutic target for several
classes of substance use disorder. We conclude by identifying opportunities for the development of
subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitors that may reduce addiction liability and minimize the side effects
that limit the clinical potential of non-selective PDE4 inhibitors. Several PDE4 inhibitors have
been clinically approved for other diseases. There is a promising possibility to repurpose these
PDE4 inhibitors for the treatment of drug addiction as they are safe and well-tolerated in patients.

Drug addiction and alcohol dependence take a high medical, social and economic toll on
society. However, options for pharmacological intervention of addictive disorders are very
limited, and currently no FDA approved medications are clinically available for the
treatment of addiction to psychostimulants. In several animal models, phosphodiesterase 4
(PDE4) inhibitors were found to reduce drug intake and/or drug seeking for
psychostimulants, alcohol, and opioids. Here, we review the current knowledge about central
nervous system (CNS) distribution of PDE4 isoforms and the effects of systemic and brain-
region specific inhibition of PDE4 on behavioral models of drug addiction.
1. The PDE4 family of phosphodiesterases
PDE4 is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase expressed in several brain regions that regulates
the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens,
ventral tegmental area, and amygdala (Cherry and Davis, 1999; Perez-Torres et al., 2000).
These brain regions are also targets of drug-associated neuroadaptations in cyclic AMP
(cAMP) signaling, and these neuroadaptations are thought to underlie aspects of drug
tolerance and dependence (Muschamp and Carlezon, 2013; Nestler, 2015; Wen et al., 2015).
In preclinical studies, PDE4 inhibitors reduce drug intake and/or drug seeking for
psychostimulants, alcohol, and opioids, suggesting that PDE4 could be a therapeutic target
for several classes of substance use disorder. However, the underlying mechanisms for the
anti-addictive behavioral effects of PDE4 inhibitors remain poorly understood. cAMP
signaling is highly compartmentalized. PDE4 inhibitors can break down such
compartmentalization and causes widespread increase in intracellular cAMP levels (Cooper,
2005). PDE4 inhibitors may disrupt or occlude cAMP-related neuroadaptations caused by
drugs of abuse. Here, we review the current knowledge about central nervous system (CNS)
distribution of PDE4 isoforms and the effects of systemic and brain-region specific
inhibition of PDE4 on behavioral models of drug addiction. We conclude by identifying
opportunities for the development of subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitors that may reduce
addiction liability and minimize the side effects that limit the clinical potential of non-
selective PDE4 inhibitors.
1.a. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) provide the sole means of degrading cAMP and cGMP
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes that hydrolyze intracellular cAMP and
cGMP (Conti et al., 2003). There are 11 subtypes of PDEs (PDE1-11) that can be classified
into three categories based on their substrate specificity. PDE4, PDE7, and PDE8 are
specific for cAMP; PDE5, PDE6, and PDE9 are specific for cGMP; and PDE1, PDE2,
PDE3, PDE10, and PDE11 hydrolyze both cAMP and cGMP (Lugnier, 2006; Zhang, 2009).
Among these isoforms, PDE4 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment
of substance abuse and substance use disorders. This review will be focused on PDE4 and
PDE4 inhibitors.
1.b. Central nervous system distribution of PDE4 isoforms
PDE4 has four isoforms, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D. Each of these isoforms are
encoded by a unique gene product (MacKenzie and Houslay, 2000; Wang et al., 2015).

Further diversity arises from splice variants among each isoform; for example, PDE4D has
11 variants, PDE4D1-11. As a result, PDE4 has over 30 isoforms or splice variants
(MacKenzie and Houslay, 2000; Wang et al., 2015). PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D have
widespread but segregated expression in different regions of the brain, while PDE4C is
largely absent from the rodent brain and found only in a limited number of regions of the
human brain (Johansson et al., 2012; Perez-Torres et al., 2000). Below, we summarize
findings of PDE4 distribution throughout the central nervous system, with emphasis on brain
regions associated with the expression of behaviors by drugs of abuse. For more complete
information on central nervous system distribution of the PDE4 isoforms, we refer the reader
to (Johansson et al., 2012; Lakics et al., 2010; Perez-Torres et al., 2000).
Striatum/Nucleus accumbens
PDE4B mRNA is high in the human and rodent striatum and nucleus accumbens, while
PDE4A and PDE4D mRNA levels are present in lower amounts (Johansson et al., 2012;
Lakics et al., 2010; Perez-Torres et al., 2000). Consistent with this, PDE4B-immunopositive
neurons and neuropil are observed in the nucleus accumbens (Cherry and Davis, 1999;
Perez-Torres et al., 2000). Within the striatum, PDE4B is differentially expressed in two
major, functionally distinct subpopulations of medium spiny neurons. Striatal medium spiny
neurons are organized into a dopamine D receptor-expressing “direct” (striatonigral) output
1
pathway and a dopamine D receptor-expressing “indirect” (striatopallidal) output pathway,
2
where the direct pathway is behaviorally stimulating, whereas the indirect pathway is
behaviorally suppressant (Graybiel, 1990, 2000). Using transgenic mice with different tags
of dopamine D and D receptors, it was found that the expression of PDE4B was higher in
1 2
D receptor-enriched striatopallidal neurons than that in D1 receptor-enriched striatonigral
2
neurons (Nishi et al., 2008). PDE4B protein is also abundant in the ventral pallidum, the
target region of the striatopallidal pathway, and this region has a similar enrichment of
PDE4B relative to the other isoforms that the striatum does (Cherry and Davis, 1999). In
drug naïve selectively bred alcohol preferring rats, PDE4A mRNA was elevated and
PDE4B2 mRNA was reduced in the accumbens relative to the non-preferring rats (Franklin
et al., 2015).
Substantia Nigra/Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)
PDE4A and 4B mRNA are low in the substantia nigra, while PDE4D was not detected in
this brain region (Johansson et al., 2012). Human mRNA analyzed by quantitative real-time
PCR demonstrated that PDE4B mRNA was approximately 3 fold higher than PDE4A and
PDE4D in the substantia nigra (Lakics et al., 2010). Protein expression in rodents largely
recapitulated this pattern, where PDE4B immunoreactivity in mouse substantia nigra was
moderate and light for PDE4D (Cherry and Davis, 1999). In the rat VTA, presence of
mRNA differed somewhat from the substantia nigra, where PDE4A was the most abundant
isoform (Perez-Torres et al., 2000). In drug naïve selectively bred high alcohol drinking
(HAD1) rats, PDE4B2 mRNA was elevated in the ventral tegmental area relative to the low
alcohol drinking (LAD1) rats (Franklin et al., 2015).

Cerebral Cortex
PDE4A, 4B, and 4D are all present in the cortex, although expression is distinct between
cortical layers. In layers V/VI of cortex, PDE4A and 4D proteins are expressed in moderate
to high amounts, while PDE4B is reported to be present only in layer V and in low amounts
(Cherry and Davis, 1999; Kuroiwa et al., 2012). In layers II/III, PDE4B and 4D are both
expressed in moderate amounts, although 4A immunoreactivity is absent in these layers
(Cherry and Davis, 1999). Quantitative analysis of human frontal cortex including all cell
layers indicates that PDE4B is the most abundant isoform, followed by 4A, then 4D (Lakics
et al., 2010)
Amygdala
Studies investigating PDE4 in the whole amygdaloid complex of the human and rodent
report low to moderate levels of PDE4A and PDE4D, and very low to low levels of PDE4B
(Johansson et al., 2012; Perez-Torres et al., 2000). In amygdalar subregions of the rodent,
there is considerable diversity in mRNA abundance of each isoform between the subregions.
PDE4A is most abundant in the medial amygdala, amygdalopiriform transition area, and
posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nuclei. PDE4B and 4D were enriched in the medial
amygdala, and in the basolateral amygdala, PDE4D was the only isoform detected (Perez-
Torres et al., 2000). In the drug naïve selectively bred alcohol preferring rats, PDE4B1
mRNA was decreased in the central amygdala relative to the non-preferring rats (Franklin et
al., 2015).
Brainstem Nausea and Emetic Centers
Although rodents do not have an emetic reflex (Horn et al., 2013), distribution of PDE4
isoforms in brainstem nausea and emetic centers is largely similar between rodents and
humans. In the human area postrema, PDE4D mRNA is the highest of the PDE4 isoforms,
while PDE4B is present in modest amounts, and PDE4A barely detectable in this region
(Mori et al., 2010). A similar pattern was observed in rat brain (Perez-Torres et al., 2000),
although while PDE4D protein was detected in mouse, PDE4B protein was not (Cherry and
Davis, 1999).
In the nucleus of the solitary tract, patterns of PDE4 mRNA appear to be similar between the
to the area postrema. In human brain, PDE4B and 4D are both enriched, while 4A is not
detectable (Mori et al., 2010; Perez-Torres et al., 2000). In the same study, relative
abundance of rat isoforms was somewhat different: PDE4A and 4D were present in
moderate amounts, while 4B was low (Perez-Torres et al., 2000). Despite these differences,
protein expression in the rat was similar to that predicted by the human mRNA data:
immunoreactivity of PDE4B and 4D were moderate, while PDE4A was undetectable
(Cherry and Davis, 1999).
To date, we are only aware of one study measuring PDE4 isoforms in the dorsal vagal motor
nucleus. In this study of human brain, PDE4D mRNA was the highest PDE4 isoform in this
region, while 4B was lower, and 4A was not detected (Mori et al., 2010).

Behavioral Tests Commonly Used in the Study of Drugs of Abuse
Locomotor Locomotor sensitization is a phenomenon where the locomotor response to a
sensitization drug (e.g., amphetamine) is increased in animals with a history of repeated drug
(Pierce and Kalivas, exposure. Previous studies have observed this increase for up to one year
1997; Robinson and following cessation of drug treatment. The basis for this test is that locomotor
Berridge, 1993, 2008) sensitization may reflect long-lasting neuroadaptations and behavioral changes
following repeated drug exposure, such as increased craving following exposure
to drug cues.
Conditioned place The conditioned place preference (CPP) test is a behavioral test that measures an
preference animal’s preference for a place that is associated with previous exposure to a
(Bardo and Bevins, reward.
2000; Liu et al., 2014; CPP protocols are typically divided into three phases: a pre-test, a conditioning
Olsen et al., 2010; phase, and a post-test. In the pre-test, a drug naïve animal is allowed to explore
Tzschentke, 2007) the entire CPP apparatus (typically composed of two or three distinct, but
connected chambers). During the conditioning phase, the animal spends time
confined to each of the chambers, however one chamber is paired with a reward
(e.g., cocaine), while the other chamber is not (e.g. saline). After several of these
pairing sessions, the animal undergoes the post-test in which the animal again is
allowed to explore the entire CPP apparatus in a drug free state. The conditioned
place preference is typically measured in one of two ways: 1) the difference in
time spent in the reward paired chamber between the pre-test and post-test or 2)
the difference in the post-test time spent in the reward paired chamber and the
non-reward paired chamber. These outcome measures are collected while the
animal is in a drug-free state.
Intravenous drug Intravenous drug self-administration is a measure of the reinforcing properties of
self-administration a drug. The basis of this test is that a positive outcome associated with a
(Allain et al., 2015; response will increase the likelihood of the response in the future. Thus,

Olsen and Winder, conditioning that uses intravenous infusion of a drug as the reinforcer.
2006; Thomsen and An animal with a chronic venous catheter is placed into an operant conditioning
Caine, 2005) chamber, where it learns that a response on the “active” manipulanda (e.g., a
lever) results in a drug infusion, whereas a response on the “inactive”
manipulanda has no consequence. Drug self-administration is considered to be
acquired when there is selectivity in responses on the active manipulanda
relative to the inactive one. The effects of treatments on drug self-administration
are typically measured as a change in drug self-administration relative to
previously stabilized intake. This outcome measure is collected while the animal
is under the influence of the drug of abuse.
Reinstatement of Reinstatement of drug seeking is a measure of drug seeking that is evoked by a
drug seeking stimulus. The basis of this test is that drug seeking (either using the CPP or the
(Conrad et al., 2013; operant response in a drug self-administration test) is first extinguished by
Mantsch et al., 2016; dissociating the connection between the drug and the drug conditioned response
Shaham et al., 2003) through repeated testing without the drug, then reinstated with a stimulus.
Stimuli that are commonly used to reinstate drug seeking include drug-
associated cues, stress, or a priming dose of the drug itself. These stimuli are
known to also elicit craving in human drug users. The outcome measures are
active and inactive manipulandum responding or time spent in the drug and
nondrug paired sides (depending on if this is a self-administration or CPP test
respectively). These measures are collected while the animal is in a drug-free
state (unless drug priming is used to reinstate drug seeking).
Two bottle choice test The two bottle choice test is a measure of voluntary alcohol intake and
for alcohol drinking preference. In this test, alcohol is concurrently available with water and food, so
(Crabbe, 2014; Lim et alcohol intake is driven by hedonic processes as opposed to metabolic need.
al., 2015; Muelbl et Outcome measures are total alcohol intake and preference (% of total fluid
al., 2016; Rodd et al., intake that is alcohol), and are collected while the subject is under the influence
2004) of the drug.
Intracranial self- Intracranial self-stimulation measures the reinforcing properties of electrical or
stimulation optogenetic stimulation of brain reward circuitry. The basis of this test is that
(Britt et al., 2012; direct stimulation of some brain regions (e.g., ventral tegmental area) or specific

(or frequencies), and treatments that enhance brain stimulation reward will
produce a left-shift in this intensity-response curve. These outcome measures are
collected while the animal is in a drug-free state, unless a treatment is tested for
its ability to modulate drug-enhanced brain stimulation reward.

Drug discrimination Drug discrimination is a test that measures the discriminative stimulus effects of
(Stolerman et al., a drug. Psychoactive drugs produce subjective feelings, which can be used to
2011; Young, 2009) signal that a specific behavioral response is required to earn a reward. For
example, an animal can be trained that after a saline infusion, pressing the left
lever in an operant conditioning chamber will deliver a food pellet. However,
after a cocaine infusion, only presses on the left lever deliver a food pellet. Test
sessions occur in the absence of food reward, and the outcome measure is the
percentage of cocaine- or saline-appropriate responses after each treatment.
There are two main types of drug discrimination tests: stimulus antagonism and
stimulus generalization. A stimulus antagonism drug discrimination test can be
used to measure the ability of a different drug to reduce the discriminative
stimulus properties of the comparator drug. For example, pretreatment with
flumazenil (an antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA-A
receptor) reduces the percentage of diazepam-appropriate responses in rats
trained to discriminate diazepam from saline. A stimulus generalization drug
discrimination test assesses the ability of a drug to generalize to another
comparative drug. For example, treatment with amphetamine will produce
cocaine-appropriate responding in animals trained to discriminate cocaine from
saline. Data are collected while the animal is under the influence of the drug.
2. Effects of PDE4 inhibitors on drug-associated behaviors
2.a. Effects of systemic administration of PDE4 inhibitors
Cocaine: A series of studies by Cherry’s group has shown that PDE4 inhibition reduces
cocaine reward, incentive saliency and seeking in rodents. They have examined the effects of
the selective PDE4 inhibitor rolipram on cocaine-induced increase in locomotor activity,
behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration (Janes
et al., 2009; Knapp et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2004). Systemic injection of rolipram 30
min before each of 5 days of cocaine injections greatly reduced cocaine-induced
hyperlocomotor activity on days 1 and 5. This treatment also reduced the locomotor
response to a challenge dose of cocaine 9 days later, indicating that rolipram treatment
during the induction phase could reduce expression of behavioral (locomotor) sensitization
to cocaine.
Administration of rolipram 30 minutes after cocaine injection did not affect the cocaine-
induced increase in locomotor activity or locomotor sensitization (Janes et al., 2009). Thus,
PDE4 inhibition must take place during the exposure to cocaine to prevent the development
of locomotor sensitization. More recent studies have shown that intracerebroventricular
injection of isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), a nonspecific PDE inhibitor that enhances
intracellular cAMP levels, does not affect the acute hyperlocomotor response to cocaine, but
reduces the development of behavioral sensitization (Schroeder et al., 2012).
The process of locomotor sensitization has been linked with incentive sensitization. The
incentive sensitization theory posits that repeated drug exposure leads to increased drug
“wanting” and ultimately, compulsive drug taking (Robinson and Berridge, 1993, 2008).
Although locomotor sensitization is not a direct measure of incentive sensitization, it is
thought to reflect analogous processes in similar neural circuitry. Thus, results suggest that
PDE inhibitors may be able to reduce drug “wanting” associated with repeated exposure.
Although PDE4 inhibitors are known to enhance cognitive functions such as learning and
memory and have been proposed as potential pharmacotherapy of cognitive decline

associate with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (Richter et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015), they
appear to dampen the formation of drug-cue associative memories. Systemic injections of
the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram before place conditioning attenuate the expression of cocaine
CPP, while injection of rolipram only before the CPP test does not alter a previously
established place preference conditioned by cocaine (Thompson et al., 2004). Rolipram
itself does not induce CPP or conditioned place aversion, nor does it alter place preference
induced by natural reward (food) (Thompson et al., 2004). These results indicate that
rolipram attenuates the acquisition, but not the expression, of CPP to cocaine without
producing any place aversion or general impairment of associative memory formation.
PDE inhibition has also been demonstrated to facilitate extinction of cocaine CPP.
Extinction of drug seeking behavior is not simply passive loss of established memory, but it
requires consolidation and formation of new memory (Bardo and Bevins, 2000; Todd et al.,
2014). It has been shown that when mice were conditioned by escalating doses of cocaine,
the CPP could not be extinguished by free exploration over several sessions (Itzhak and
Anderson, 2012). In this escalating dose model, the PDE9 (cGMP specific) inhibitor
BAY-73-6691 facilitated extinction and reduced cocaine primed reinstatement of CPP. In the
same model, the PDE4 (cAMP specific) inhibitor rolipram did not have a significant effect
on the extinction of cocaine CPP (Liddie et al., 2012). These results indicate that different
subtypes of PDEs regulate the acquisition vs. extinction of drug-cue associative memories.
In rats trained to self-administer cocaine on a fixed-ratio 5 schedule (5 active responses
required per infusion), systemic administration of either rolipram or Ro 20-1724 caused a
significant reduction in cocaine intake (Knapp et al., 1999). This reduction was largely
attributed to an increase in the latency to initiate operant responding, and food self-
administration was reduced in a similar pattern following Ro 20-1724 (Knapp et al., 1999),
suggesting that these drugs may have a general effect on inhibiting motivated behavior or
reinforcement processes. This finding emphasizes the fact that systemic administration of
PDE4 inhibitors can have sedative effects and/or actions in brainstem emetic centers that
may non-specifically alter behavioral phenotypes.
Methamphetamine: Beardsley and coworkers have done a series of studies examining the
effects of non-selective PDE inhibitor ibudilast and its analogs on methamphetamine abuse.
Similar to the aforementioned effects on cocaine-associated hyperlocomotion, they report
that ibudilast and its analog AV1013 reduce the methamphetamine-induced increase in
locomotor activity and sensitization without significantly affecting locomotor activity by
itself (Snider et al., 2012). In addition, ibudilast and AV1013 are effective in attenuating
methamphetamine self-administration and drug seeking behavior. Systemic administration
of these compounds reduces methamphetamine self-administration on an FR1 schedule in
the rat (Snider et al., 2013). Systemic ibudilast and AV1013 significantly reduces footshock-
and prime-induced reinstatement of methamphetamine-seeking in the rat (Beardsley et al.,
2010). Interestingly, the reduction of drug seeking behavior by ibudilast and its analog may
be associated with inflammatory processes. Methamphetamine activates glial cells and
increases proinflammatory cytokine production in the brain, and glial cell activation and
inflammatory responses have been linked to drug abuse-related behavior (Beardsley and
Hauser, 2014). Ibudilast inhibits both PDE and glial proinflammatory activity, while

AV1013 shares the anti-inflammatory activity of ibudilast but only negligibly inhibits PDE
(Snider et al., 2012). These results suggest that modulation of glial inflammatory activity
also contributes to the attenuation of methamphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization and
relapse of drug seeking by ibudilast and AV1013, and targeting glial cells may provide a
novel approach to pharmacotherapy for treating methamphetamine abuse.
Methamphetamine and cocaine are psychostimulants that share similar mechanisms of
increasing extracellular dopamine levels in the brain (Anderson and Pierce, 2005), and many
of the behavioral measures discussed above are dopamine-dependent. In vivo microdialysis
shows that rolipram increases striatal cAMP levels but does not significantly alter
methamphetamine-induced increase in striatal dopamine levels (Iyo et al., 1996), suggesting
that rolipram-induced changes in behaviors are not due to direct modulation of striatal
dopamine.
Alcohol: Regulation of alcohol drinking by many different subtypes of PDEs and the
underlying signaling mechanisms involved have been recently reviewed in great detail
(Logrip, 2015). In this review, we will review recent progress of studying behavioral effects
of PDE4 inhibitors on alcohol drinking.
Reduction of alcohol drinking by PDE4 inhibitors was first shown in in C57BL/6J mice with
unlimited 2-bottle choice access to alcohol. Rolipram and Ro 20-1724 reduce alcohol intake
and preference without altering total fluid intake, intake of sucrose or quinine, alcohol-
induced sedation, or alcohol metabolism (Hu et al., 2011). Subsequently, this observation
was extended to Fawn-Hooded rats and other animal models of alcohol drinking. Acute
administration of rolipram dose-dependently reduces operant self-administration of alcohol,
and chronic rolipram treatment decreases 2-bottle choice alcohol consumption and
preference (Wen et al., 2012).
The non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor ibudilast reduces 2-bottle choice alcohol
drinking and relapse in alcohol-preferring P rats, high-alcohol drinking HAD1 rats, and in
alcohol-dependent C57BL/6J mice at doses which had no effect on alcohol drinking in non-
dependent mice (Bell et al., 2015). Taken together, these studies indicate that PDE inhibitors
reduce alcohol drinking in multiple rodent models, including models of genetic
susceptibility and dependence. Given that ibudilast is a non-selective PDE inhibitor, this
study raises the question whether inhibitors to other PDE subtypes reduce alcohol drinking
and dependence. Using 24-h two-bottle choice and two-bottle choice with limited (3-h)
access to alcohol in C56BL/6J male mice, a recent study has compared the effects of nine
PDE inhibitors with different subtype selectivity. Interestingly, only the selective PDE4
inhibitors reduce ethanol intake and preference in the 24-h two-bottle choice test and in the
limited access test (Blednov et al., 2014). More recent studies have shown that the PDE10A
inhibitor TP-10 reduces alcohol self-administration in conditions predisposing to elevated
self-administration. In addition, TP-10 also reduces alcohol self-administration in
genetically alcohol-preferring rats, and in alcohol-non-dependent and -dependent rats
(Logrip et al., 2014). Taken together, the above studies suggest that PDE4 and PDE10A are
potential therapeutic targets for pharmacotherapy of alcohol dependence.

Opioids: PDE4 inhibitors reduce morphine-induced hyperlocomotor activity and CPP. It has
been shown that systemic injections of rolipram suppresses morphine-induced
hyperlocomotion (Mori et al., 2000). In addition, administration of rolipram 30 min prior to
conditioning sessions blocks the acquisition of CPP to morphine, while of administration of
rolipram 30 min prior to CPP test does not affect the expression of morphine CPP
(Thompson et al., 2004). The PDE inhibitor rolipram also inhibits the discriminative-
stimulus effects of morphine in rats (Yan et al., 2006). Taken together, these results suggest
that the cAMP signaling cascade may play a key role in the acquisition of conditioned
morphine reward.
The PDE4 inhibitor rolipram does not significantly inhibit heroin self-administration under
the fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule, but dose-dependently decreases the reward values under the
progressive ratio schedule. Importantly, rolipram also decreases the cue- and heroin priming-
induced reinstatement of heroin seeking (Lai et al., 2014). Rolipram increases the expression
of phosphorylated CREB in the nucleus accumbens, which is correlated with its effect on
heroin-seeking behavior (Lai et al., 2014). These results suggest that PDE4 inhibitors may
be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of heroin and morphine dependence.
PDE4 inhibitors were shown to attenuate naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal
symptoms. In rats treated with single morphine, naloxone challenge induces an increase in
PDE4 activity on frontal cortex and hippocampus. In contrast, in rats treated repeatedly with
morphine, the naloxone challenge produced no significant effects on PDE4 activity although
cyclic AMP was significantly increased by naloxone challenge (Kimura et al., 2006). These
results suggest that the lack of PDE4 activation leads to an increase in levels of cAMP,
which may be involved in naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal symptoms (Kimura et
al., 2006). Consistent with this premise, subsequent studies have shown that repeated
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections, but not acute injections, of PDE4 inhibitors rolipram dampen
naloxone-precipitated behavioral signs of morphine withdrawal, such as teeth-chattering,
tremor, piloerection, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, ptosis, spontaneous jumping and wet-dog
shakes, and weight loss (Gonzalez-Cuello et al., 2007; Hamdy et al., 2001; Mamiya et al.,
2001; Nunez et al., 2009). The attenuation of withdrawal syndrome by the PDE4 inhibitors
is likely mediated by the up-regulation of the cAMP signaling (Gonzalez-Cuello et al., 2007;
Nunez et al., 2009). Chronic rolipram treatment in combination with morphine in mice
blocked the increase in the expression of c-Fos protein induced by naloxone challenge
(Hamdy et al., 2001).
PDE4 inhibitors reduce opioid-induced respiratory depression. In rats, intravenous injection
of rolipram blocked morphine-induced prolongation and flattening of inspiratory discharge
in the phrenic nerve but not did not affect morphine-induced suppression of paw withdrawal
responses to nociceptive thermal stimulation. These results suggest that inhibition of PDE4
can block morphine-induced ventilatory depression without loss of analgesia (Kimura et al.,
2015).

in the mesocorticolimbic system. c-Fos is part of the AP-1 transcription complex that results
in activation of signaling cascades thought to be important in several functions, including
synaptic and behavioral plasticity (Alberini, 2009; Hiroi and Nestler, 1998; Perez-Cadahia et
al., 2011). Within the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens, rolipram has no effect on
cocaine-induced expression of c-Fos, although rolipram itself increases levels in the nucleus
accumbens shell (Thompson et al., 2004). These results suggest that either rolipram does not
exert effects on induction via altered c-Fos expression, or the site/s of effects on c-Fos lies
outside of the striatum.
There is also evidence that PDE activity in the nucleus accumbens can modulate the
reinforcing effect of intracranial self-stimulation of the VTA. Infusion of rolipram into the
nucleus accumbens decreases the threshold of intracranial self-stimulation and enhances the
effects of systemic cocaine on lowering the threshold of intracranial self-stimulation (Knapp
et al., 2001). These results suggest that increasing the activity of cyclic AMP (cAMP)
pathways within the nucleus accumbens may enhance general brain reward function.
Incubation of craving is a phenomenon where drug or reward seeking increases with longer
periods of abstinence (Grimm et al., 2005; Grimm et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2004). Incubation
of heroin craving after 14 days of abstinence relative to 1 day was associated with decreased
phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in the nucleus accumbens, and intra-accumbens rolipram
reduced drug seeking and increased local pCREB levels (Sun et al., 2015).
2.b.2. Ventral Tegmental area—We have shown that intra-VTA injection of rolipram
before cocaine and saline conditioning blocked the acquisition of cocaine CPP, whereas
intra-VTA injection of rolipram just before the CPP test did not affect the expression of
cocaine CPP (Zhong et al., 2012). Thus, PDE4 inhibition within the VTA is sufficient to
reproduce the ability of systemic rolipram to prevent the establishment of CPP.
Long-term synaptic plasticity in reward circuitry is thought to underlie reinforcement
learning and the development of addictive behavior (Kauer, 2004). Our previous studies have
implicated endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression of inhibitory synaptic
transmission (I-LTD) in cocaine-induced inhibitory synaptic plasticity and behavioral effects
(Pan et al., 2008a, b; Pan et al., 2011). Cannabinoid receptors (CB ) are G protein-coupled
1 i/o
receptors whose activation leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC), resulting in
decreased cAMP/PKA activity (Howlett, 2005), while PDE4 inhibition is known to enhance
cAMP levels. We found that PDE4 inhibitors rolipram and Ro 20-1724 blocked
endocannabinoid I-LTD and synaptic depression induced by D dopamine receptor and
2
cannabinoid CB receptor agonists in VTA dopamine neurons [Figure 1, (Zhong et al.,
1
2012)]. These results suggest that blockade of cocaine-induced inhibitory synaptic plasticity
within the VTA is a likely cellular mechanism by which PDE4 inhibition impairs CPP to
cocaine.

3. Therapeutic opportunities of PDE4 inhibitors
3.a. Clinical studies with PDE4 inhibitors
PDE4 inhibitors have been under clinical trials for the treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma (Diamant and Spina, 2011; Page and Spina, 2012), and
depression (Bertolino et al., 1988; Fleischhacker et al., 1992). Roflumilast is the only
approved PDE4 inhibitor for the treatment of COPD, and it reduces COPD exacerbations
and modestly improves lung function (Mulhall et al., 2015). More recently, the PDE4
inhibitor MK-0952 has been under a phase II clinical trial for cognition-enhancing effects
(Wang et al., 2015). Apremilast is an orally effective PDE4 inhibitor that was approved by
US FDA in 2015 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic
arthritis (Gisondi and Girolomoni, 2016). It is safe and well-tolerated, although it causes
nausea and vomiting in some patients (Gisondi and Girolomoni, 2016). As mentioned earlier
in this review, preclinical studies with animal models have shown that the non-selective PDE
inhibitor ibudilast reduces drug seeking behaviors of methamphetamine (Beardsley et al.,
2010; Snider et al., 2013; Snider et al., 2012) and alcohol-dependence (Bell et al., 2015).
Ibudilast is currently in a Phase I clinical trial for alcohol use disorders as well as in Phase II
clinical trials for methamphetamine dependence and oxycodone abuse (Logrip, 2015).
Ibudilast inhibits both PDE and glial proinflammatory activity, which has been linked to its
anti-addiction effects (Beardsley and Hauser, 2014). Thus, PDE inhibitors may represent a
promising candidate for developing anti-addiction medications. PDE4 inhibitors have
adverse side-effects such as nausea and emesis, which limit their clinical utility (O’Donnell
and Zhang, 2004). Activation of PDE4D, which is highly expressed in the area postrema, an
emetic-trigger zone (Lamontagne et al., 2001), is related to emetic potential of PDE4
inhibitors (Robichaud et al., 2002). Subtype- or isoform-specific PDE4 inhibitors are
expected to be developed in the future to minimize their off-target effects (Wang et al.,
2015). Paradoxically, non-selective, broader acting drugs such as ibudilast may retain the
pharmacological efficacy of PDE inhibition with less side effects. Alternatively, targeting
PDE4A or 4B, PDE isoforms with expression in mesocorticolimbic circuitry, may prove to
be effective in treatment of substance drug and/or alcohol abuse without inducing the degree
of nausea that non-selective PDE4 inhibitors do.
3.b. Opportunities
There are at least 30 isoforms and splice variants of PDE4 (MacKenzie and Houslay, 2000;
Wang et al., 2015), which presents challenges and opportunities for pharmacological
intervention of drug addiction. As mentioned earlier in this review, a number of PDE4
inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of COPD and inflammatory
diseases (Gisondi and Girolomoni, 2016; Mulhall et al., 2015). There is a promising
possibility to repurpose these PDE4 inhibitors for the treatment of drug addiction as these
inhibitors are known to be safe and well-tolerated in patients.
PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram often cause nausea and emesis, which prevent their clinical
utility (Hansen and Zhang, 2015). The emetic effects are likely mediated by PDE4 expressed
in the area postrema, the emetic center of the brain (Mori et al., 2010). PDE4A is
predominantly expressed in the olfactory system, PDE4B is highly expressed in the

mesolimbic dopamine system, and PDE4D is expressed in many parts of the brain, but not in
the VTA and nucleus accumbens (Cherry and Davis, 1999). PDE4 inhibition-induced
reduction of the effects of drugs of abuse may be mediated primarily by PDE4B. Selective
PDE4B inhibitors may represent an effective means to reduce drug seeking behavior while
avoiding emetic effects of PDE4 inhibitors that are mediated by activation of the PDE4D.
Recently a series of triazine derivatives were found to be PDE4B selective inhibitors, which
show >100-fold selectivity over the PDE4D isozyme. These PDE4B inhibitors exhibited
potent anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and showed less emesis (Hagen et al., 2014;
Naganuma et al., 2009). PDE4B inhibition may also have effects on generalized anxiety,
which could influence drug craving during abstinence. Knockout of a large region of the
catalytic domain (exons 8–11) resulted in increased anxiety-like behavior in the several
assays (Zhang et al., 2008), although there was no difference in the elevated plus maze
(Siuciak et al., 2008). In contrast, reduction of cAMP hydrolization via Y358C substitution
within the catalytic subregion reduced anxiety-like behavior (McGirr et al., 2016). These
conflicting results make it difficult to predict how a particular PDE4B specific inhibitor may
influence generalized anxiety during drug abstinence, however inhibitors with selectivity for
the PDE4B are predicted to have a strong potential for alleviating drug craving without the
emetic effects associated with non-selective PDE4 inhibition.

Selective PDE4 inhibitors rolipram and Ro 20-1724 blocked I-LTD in VTA dopamine
neurons. (A) The presence of cocaine (3 μM; indicated by horizontal bar) during the 10 Hz
stimulation (indicated by arrow “↑”) induced I-LTD in VTA dopamine neurons (n = 6). This
I-LTD was blocked by PDE4 inhibitors rolipram (1 μM; n = 8; p < 0.05 vs. control) and Ro
20-1724 (200 μM; n = 8; p < 0.05 vs. control). The PDE4 inhibitors were present throughout
the whole-cell recordings. Sample IPSCs before (indicated by “1”) and after (indicated by
“2”) the 10 Hz stimulation are shown on the top. (B) The presence of D receptor agonist
2
quinpirole (1 μM) during the 10 Hz stimulation induced I-LTD in VTA dopamine neurons (n
= 7). This I-LTD was blocked by rolipram (1 μM; n = 8; p < 0.05 vs. control) or Ro 20-1724
(200 μM; n = 7; p < 0.05 vs. control). Error bars indicate SEM (used with the permission of
