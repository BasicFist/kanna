Abstract
Objectives: The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of two doses (8mg and 25mg
once daily) of a 2:1 standardized extract of the South African medicinal plant Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E. Br.,
trademarked Zembrin(cid:2) in healthy adult volunteers over a three-month period.
,
Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled single center study.
Setting: Tiervlei Trial Centre, Karl Bremer Hospital, Bellville, Cape Town, South Africa.
Participants: The study took place between February 2 and July 27, 2009. Thirty-seven healthy adults were
recruited from the general population.
Intervention: Participantswererandomizedtoreceiveeitheroneoftwodosesofstudymedication,oranidentical
placebo, taken once daily for 3 months. Of the 37 subjects, 12, 12, and 13 subjects received 8mg extract Sceletium
tortuosum(Zembrin(cid:2)),25mgextractSceletiumtortuosum(Zembrin(cid:2)),andplacebotreatment,respectively.
Outcomemeasures:Noefficacyvariableswereassessed.Thesafetyandtolerabilityvariablescomprisedofvital
signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory assessments (hematology, biochem-
istry, and urinalysis), and the recording of adverse events (AEs).
Results: There were no apparent differences between the three treatments with regard to vital signs, 12-lead
ECG, body weight, and physical examination from screening to the end of the 3-month treatment period. No
significant changes were observed in hematology or biochemistry parameters between initialscreening and the
endofthestudy.BothdosesofextractSceletiumtortuosum(Zembrin(cid:2))werewell-tolerated.Themostcommonly
reported AEwas headache,followed by abdominalpain and upper respiratory tract infections, allwith greater
incidence in the placebo group than in the treatment groups. Unsolicited positive effects on well-being were

Conclusion: Both doses of extract Sceletium tortuosum (Zembrin(cid:2)) (8mg and 25mg) were well tolerated when
used by healthy human subjects once daily for 3 months.
