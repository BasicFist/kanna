Sceletium tortuosum
Zembrin® tium tortuosum is currently of widespread scientific interest due to its clinical potential in treating anxiety and
depression, relieving stress in healthy individuals, and enhancing cognitive functions. These pharmacological
Psychoactive
Antidepressant actions are attributed to its phytochemical constituents referred to as mesembrine-type alkaloids.
Aim of the review: The aim of this review was to comprehensively summarize and critically evaluate recent
research advances on the phytochemistry, pharmacokinetics, biological and clinical activities of the medicinal
plant S. tortuosum. Additionally, current ongoing research and future perspectives are also discussed.
Methods: All relevant scientific articles, books, MSc and Ph.D. dissertations on botany, behavioral pharmacology,
traditional uses, and phytochemistry of S. tortuosum were retrieved from different databases (including Science
Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science). For pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects
of S. tortuosum, the focus fell on relevant publications published between 2009 and 2021.
Results: Twenty-five alkaloids belonging to four structural classes viz: mesembrine, Sceletium A4, joubertiamine,
and tortuosamine, have been identified from S. tortuosum, of which the mesembrine class is predominant. The
crude extracts and commercially available standardized extracts of S. tortuosum have displayed a wide spectrum
of biological activities (e.g. antimalarial, anti-oxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-HIV, neuroprotection,
enhancement of cognitive function) in in vitro or in vivo studies. This plant has not yet been studied in a clinical
population, but has potential for enhancing cognitive function, and managing anxiety and depression.
Conclusion: As an important South African medicinal plant, S. tortuosum has garnered many research advances on
its phytochemistry and biological activities over the last decade. These scientific studies have shown that
S. tortuosum has various bioactivities. The findings have further established the link between the phytochemistry
and pharmacological application, and support the traditional use of S. tortuosum in the indigenous medicine of
South Africa.

in S. tortuosum raw materials and commercial products. The HPTLC
method was validated, and the results obtained from the sample analysis
correlated well with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
method. In the same year, the same research group published a validated
method using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC)
with a reversed-phase column and photodiode array (PDA) detection to
quantify the four alkaloids in S. tortuosum (Shikanga et al., 2012c).

developed and validated a sensitive UHPLC-MS method for the accurate

Freund et al. (2018) developed a leaf spray MS technique in order to
facilitate the rapid detection of plant metabolites without using chro-
