The exceptionally high plant diversity of the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) comprises a combination of
ancient lineages and young radiations.Aprevious phylogenetic study of Aizoaceae subfamily Ruschioideae dated
the radiation of this clade of >1500 species in the GCFR to 3.8–8.7 Mya, establishing it as a flagship example of
a diversification event triggered by the onset of a summer-arid climate in the region. However, a more recent
analysis found an older age for the Ruschioideae lineage (17Mya), suggesting that the group may in fact have
originated much before the aridification of the region 10–15Mya. Here, we reassess the tempo of radiation of ice
plants by using the most complete generic-level phylogenetic tree for Aizoaceae to date, a revised calibration age

plants and find that diversity is strongly linked with precipitation, temperature, topographic complexity and the
evolution of highly succulent leaves and wide-band tracheids. © 2013 The Authors. Botanical Journal of the
