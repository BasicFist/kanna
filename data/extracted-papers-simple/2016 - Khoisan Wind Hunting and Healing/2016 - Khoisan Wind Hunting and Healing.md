Khoisan wind: hunting
and healing
CHRIS Low University of Oxford
In this paper I draw on my findings and those of historical and recent Khoisan ethnography to
attempt to explain how these southern African 'Khoi' and San peoples relate to wind and how the
environmental phenomenon has informed their epistemology and ontology. I begin by fleshing out
the knowledge and experience of wind among these past and recent hunter-gatherers and, pointing
to continuity in wind relationships and the ideas that stem from them, I go on to demonstrate how
wind weaves into Khoisan understandings of the body and illness. Despite extensive interest in
Bushman healing, anthropologists have overwhelmingly concentrated on the 'trance' healing dance.
My findings suggest this partiality has obscured the wider healing context in which the dance
operates. Exploring the wider context, including massage, 'medicinal cuts', and witchcraft, reveals
that the 'potency' conceived as central to the healing dance is, in certain contexts, equivalent to
overlapping ideas of wind, arrows, and smell. Examination of the ethnography reveals that a number
of the associations I make between wind and potency have been partially recognized in specific
Khoisan contexts but, because comparative studies of Khoisan are difficult and unpopular, these
similarities have gone largely unnoticed.
Wind sits at the heart of a nexus of ideas and practice among the southern African
'Khoi" and San peoples. Understandings of wind tie into notions of potency - linked
to identity and 'smell essence', spirits, dead people, illness, and contagion. Moving wind
is offered by some Khoisan as a rationale for medical treatments, including massage,
'medicinal cuts', and the wearing of powerful animal- or plant-based necklaces and
bracelets. Sharing wind essence ties people and animals together across time and space.
Because of persistent 'Western' interest in Khoisan since the seventeenth century, the
material available for this discussion of wind is both rich and diverse. Little of the material
I draw upon has previously been explicitly associated with notions of wind, despite the
clear currency and contiguity of wind ideas across this diverse group of historical and
contemporary peoples. The reasons for this, what appears to be essentially a fragmen-
tation of Western understanding, seem to lie equally in the partiality of the ethnographic
enterprise and the particularly flexible and slippery nature of Khoisan ideas.
Wind in its many guises is an invisible gift attributed to 'God' - as envisaged by
Christianized Khoisan. The gift is not identical but specific. Each living entity has its

own wind or smell which is a personalized expression of the breathing divinity and self
evident in the act of respiration. Different winds define a particular sort of life, or
person, which reveals itself to Khoisan in a 'phenomenology of encounter'. There is
continuity between the wind that blows and the wind that people breathe and the
winds that move between people, certain animals, and possibly some plants. Wind,
often equally conceived as smell, can move between phenomena, embedding itself in
the perceiver. The smell is a living connection between one organism and another,
enabling one essentially to become the other.
My analysis lays out a Khoisan way of thinking that is drawn from their survival
strategies and day-to-day knowledge of the environment and feeds into their ideas of
cosmology, health, and the body. I additionally highlight how anthropology has frag-
mented Khoisan ideas, firstly, by biasing inquiry towards Western categories of interest,
and, secondly, by concentrating on cultural microcosms which have disassociated
particular Khoisan ideas from their wider Khoisan cultural context. What becomes
apparent is the difficulty associated with linguistic representation of Khoisan ideas and
how the combination of Khoisan linguistic and ideational flexibility, together with
inconsistent anthropological representations, can influence the visibility of coherent
Khoisan understandings. Whilst I fully recognize a need to be specific in analysis of
separate Khoisan linguistic groups, I nevertheless believe the evidence points very
strongly towards a consistent pattern of like thought and behaviour.
What I present is a series of associations, themes, and ideas drawn from historical
and recent accounts of Khoisan alongside data and interpretations arising from eight
months of fieldwork undertaken in Namibia in 2001 (Low 2004). During the fieldwork
I recorded one hundred semi-structured interviews focusing on matters of healing. The
interviews were supplemented by informal conversations and participant observation.
Following an outline of how Khoisan encounter wind and what it means to them at
a personal level, I proceed to explore how the wind that blows becomes internalized,
subsequently manifesting as the motive force behind individuals and 'personalities' in
nature. It is in its personal manifestation that wind most equates with smell, and when
conceptualized in this manner it becomes a powerful agent of transformation.
I begin this discussion of wind by working from macrocosmic to microcosmic
associations - from the wind that blows in the trees to the wind that moves in the body.
Whilst this dichotomy serves as a fluid entry point to the discussion, it also reflects an
essential Khoisan recognition, acknowledged and articulated at a conversational level,
that there are different winds - the ones that blow and the one that gives life. As
discussion progresses I hope to illustrate how this juxtaposition dissolves in contexts of
personal and group ways of knowing, thinking, and talking.
The following personal accounts of wind are revealing of its wider significance
amongst Khoisan. They help illustrate the day-to-day knowledge of wind that informs
behaviour and Khoisan concepts of life.
A Damara family from Puros in the northwestern Kaokoveld related how wind
affects the growth of food plants and how the action of different winds thereby deter-
mines their food collection strategies.2
When winter wind [sao: winter, = oab: wind] blows it makes the xori fruit come out. It makes it grow
and ripen because he blows and pulls the //hao plant off [clears the ground of everything so trees can
grow]. The east wind [ai # oab] does not bring anything. He burns the plants, he blows too much and
burns the plants. The west wind [huri n oab] blows and cleans the fruit outside [takes the skin off] and
the winter wind makes them ripe - the wild food - and we go out and collect some fruit.

In an informal round-up of the day's work, my translator and friend Suro Ganuses, a
Damara woman from Sesfontein, summarized what the wind, = oab, meant to her.3
Suro talked of relationships between wind, sickness, and animal behaviour.
The north wind [ao /oab]4 brings flies, colds, and coughs. The west wind brings biting flies to
Khowarib [a nearby settlement]. The west wind brings out snakes, scorpions, and a many-legged
khaki-coloured spider-like creature, an harare. It is hairy with a body about four centimetres long
and it sucks the testicles of men. Wind [ifoab] is bad for women and young boys up to about the
age of 2.
Suro knows of an 18-year-old boy who a short time ago was cycling home to Sesfontein
from the coast when he was killed by the east wind. The east wind is a summer wind
and is very hot. Whilst the boy cycled, Suro was taking part in a healing dance, an arus.
A healer at the centre of the dance smelled that something bad was happening far away.
The healer knew, after having heard of the death of the boy, that this death lay behind
the smell in the dance.5
Like Suro's account of the dying cyclist, another Damara woman believed also that
the drum at an arus that I witnessed was 'not good'. She recognized after the dance that
the wind must have been carrying bad news and preventing the drumming from
working. The phenomenon of wind carrying news is part of wider Khoisan belief of
wind as a transmitter of information, whether specifically concerning people and
hunting or more generally.
A Hai//om/Damara man in Tstintsabis, just east of Etosha, replied to my question
'What can you tell me about the wind?' with:
It is a thing of the God. There is the west to north wind, //khabasi, that is not good for hunting. He is
the wind from everywhere. The north to south wind, =/=ga -oa, is the best wind for hunting because
he just blows straight to one side. The wind from the east, /hf!hub=oab, is not good. When he is
blowing you are at the side of the wind, it is on your belt, you I/nhi [I/ndi, to put on (belt) (Haacke
& Eiseb 1999: 90)] the wind so the animal gets your smell.6
Ju/'hoansi Bushmen related that there are two types of wind: mh, 'the soft one', and da,
the bad one that twists strongly and penetrates you. Such twisting winds or whirlwinds,
also referred to as Il//Gauwa 0/a, or Il//Gauwa smell, after the name of the Ju/'hoansi's
chief divinity, are a relatively common feature of the Kalahari.
These various perspectives indicate a particular way of relating to environmental
wind. They also demonstrate strong resemblances to nineteenth-century /Xam
Bushmen comments on wind. Similar to the smell-wind revealing the death of the
cyclist, a /Xam man observed:'For the wind cries for us, that we may know that another
friend is dying'. An alternative /Xam comment draws attention to the relationship
between wind, people, and animals: 'Things which walk about hear the wind as it
sweeps past our hut. Then the beasts of prey seem to know where we are, for they hear
the wind calling to them' (D.E Bleek 1932: 330-1). Elsewhere again a /Xam Bushman
reported: '[A] story is like the wind, it comes from a far-off quarter and we feel it'
(Guenther 1999: 139).
Out of her folklore studies, Biesele has presented convincing arguments for conti-
nuities between historical Cape /Xam and recent Bushmen by pointing to parallels in
their respective hunter-gatherer or recent hunter-gatherer lifestyles which have
informed a shared 'imaginative substrate' (1993: 13). Lewis-Williams and Dowson have

further emphasized the healing dance as a key arena of continuity that draws on a
persistent 'subcontinental cognitive set' (1994: 220). Khoisan relationships with wind,
healing, and hunting engage with essential elements of this cognitive set. The archival
/Xam material corresponds to findings amongst recent Bushmen and allows the flesh-
ing out of broad patterns of Khoisan thought and behaviour with a significant histo-
rical dimension. Collectively the evidence indicates persistent patterns of Khoisan
relationships with wind. Khoisan know that wind affects the behaviour of animals and
the growth of plants. They also know wind can be dangerous both in association with
the storms it brings and through its ability to penetrate people, in a physical and
'potent' sense related to personal smell. To Khoisan as current inhabitants of rural
Africa who maintain proximity with the environment and wild animals, wind holds
real consequences for their survival, as it has done for Bushmen in the past.
The potency of wind lies in the effects it produces, by which its existence is known.
It is equally defined by its ability to connect all that exists in it. For Khoisan, the im-
plications of these two qualities are crucial. Fundamentally, wind is tied to the phenom-
enon of life. A Hai//om woman, Erika Gubes, stated,'When the wind blows the people say
it is the God who is breathing'.' Mirroring or reproducing Christian and other beliefs, the
wind or breath of God enters people and animals and gives them life. In wind, God bestows
and unites life and removes the footprints of the departed from the dust.
One of my assistants, Frederick //Awaseb, a Hai//om man, gave his account of wind:
There is a special wind blown by the God [Eloba]. We breathe it in and out from that //hom[?], the
pipe we eat and swallow food with and the big intestine. If the wind cries inside you die. When lying
down you are about to die. The wind is special because you cannot see it. It blows for our life, it is the
God who is breathing, even the sun and the moon work with the wind, even the clouds also, they move
also with the wind and the rain comes with the wind. Now there is no rain wind but at rain time you
see the wind change and it can blow sunrise to sunset and everybody knows it is the time of the rain.
The two bad winds //khabisi f/oas, *nabi -/oas, bring sickness but the sore fghs -oab does not.8
Frederick's comments point to the subtle layering of conceptions of wind. In different
contexts wind becomes differentiated into special God-given and life-giving wind or
wind of a particular nature or identity with particular consequences, such as rain.
The idea of breathing in a life-giving, God-derived wind overlaps with notions of
soul. A number of Nama women explained to me that when we breathe in and out we
are breathing in and out /om, soul. It is the wind that works with the heart. In
Khoekhoegowab (mainly Nama, Damara, Hai//om) the same word, /om, is used for
breath and soul.
The wind that God gives people and animals is a specific gift of life. The gift is a
personal wind that underlies an organism's form and action and constitutes its
potency. The gift of life is visible in the breathing, standing, and participation of people
and animals in a shared environment. Standing as a synonym for life is a particularly
significant idiom amongst the Khoisan.
L6vy-Bruhl provides a helpful way of conceptualizing Khoisan ideas of personal
wind. Following Cushing's work on Zuni Indians, he highlighted a link made by
'primitive' peoples between what something does and its form. The form of something
both gives it its power and restricts its power (Ldvy-Bruhl 1985: 38). The form defines
the potency in strength and nature. An elephant is big and strong; it therefore does big
and strong things. A bird flies because it has feathers and wings. In human terms
personal potency relates to the form of someone - the stock of what they are and what
they can do. In a sense, their form is their wind and it is moveable.

In certain contexts the idea of wind/soul/potency runs to plants, but this usage is
rare. Smell is more commonly the way plant properties are conceptualized. It is, for
instance, the smell of a plant that removes sickness from a body, whereas in treatments
that involve human healing or animal medicine, wind or smell tend to be used to
describe the active principle.
Wind, environmental awareness, and tracking
A comment from the /Xam Bushmen reiterates the very real role that wind played
and plays amongst Khoisan: '[T]he crying of the wind tells the beasts of prey where
to find people; and when it blows strongly they can approach the dwelling unheard'
(Lloyd 1889: 203). When listened to, or smelled, wind tells Khoisan where animals are.
It also tells animals where Khoisan are. The direction of wind must be known if a
hunter is to avoid alerting his prey to his presence. Wind connects the hunter with
the prey like a thread leading from one body to another. The relationship is a deeper
one founded in a wider co-evolution. Wind or smells and pheromones draw and
repulse organisms to their mutual ends. When the wind of an animal or plant enters
a Khoisan body there is a unity between the two phenomena. Wind smells lock par-
ticipants into a web of relationships. The essence of one organism connects with
another. The consequences can be powerful. The hunter links to the prey; the wind
potency of the healer cures the sick; the wind of the sick person transmits his or her
illness.
Many animals, and particularly ones of consequence to Khoisan, including preda-
tory lions, hyenas, and strong-smelling aardwolves, clearly spray or rub powerful scent
over their respective territories. These markers serve as an anchor of encounter and
influence between the animal and the Khoisan who smell them and watch them
rubbing and spraying. The scent marker binds the one who encounters them into a
powerful relationship of consequence, in a similar bind as that existing between the
tracker, the track, and the animal. Potency is both a bound quality of the potential
consequences of connection and the formal essence that lies behind that connection.
Khoisan use certain animal remedies, particularly from strong-'smelling' animals or
animals, which bring significant consequences, because their strong smell carries the
essence, wind, or potency of the animal. A person with the medicine becomes poten-
tized and takes on the wind of the source, thus both absorbing the power of the source
and serving as a means of protection against it.
The idiom of connection that lies behind wind is particularly evident in relation to
the tracking of animals. To my fanciful question, loosely informed by Wilhelm Bleek
and Laurens van der Post, of whether or not he knew where animals are without seeing
them, a Ju/'hoansi (!Kung) man, Cwi Cucga, answered with the pragmatic comment,'If
I see the footprints I know where they are. You can also use the wind. You cannot go
with it, you must turn and start at the end, come through the wind so the animal cannot
smell you'.9 As Cwi's comment suggests, there is a very real sense in which wind is a
scent thread. Khoisan tap onto the scent threads that riddle the natural environment
and many are very aware of the role that scent plays in survival.
Tom Brown, an American tracker mentored in his youth by an old Apache scout, is
highly informative concerning apposite ways of thinking about threads and tracking.
The parallels between his Apache-inspired thinking and Khoisan thinking are striking.
Brown relates that:

The first track is the end of a string. At the far end, a being is moving; a mystery dropping a hint about
itself every so many feet, telling you more about itself until you can almost see it, even before you come
to it. The mystery reveals itself slowly, track by track ... Further on, it will tell you the intimate details
of its life and work, until you know the maker of the track like a lifelong friend (1979: 1).
By standing in the path of a track or within the smell of an animal one is joined to that
animal. The odour communicates the qualities of the source (Classen 1993: 98) and
engages the smeller within the realm of the scent-provider. Through tracking one can
know where an animal is, where it sleeps, where it hides, and when it drinks. It is
possible to tell what it reacts to and what it ignores, its likes and dislikes, and its
interactions with other animals (Brown 1999: 8). Knowing an animal's smell is a part of
this knowing of an animal. It is not trite to remember that smells operate amongst
people as they do amongst animals. Smells serve as a means of recognition, alerting the
receiver to possible threats; they mark territory, attract and repulse. Smells reveal the
presence of water and help identify good and bad food. The identification and mapping
of a smell in relation to a Khoisan person sits within a constant process of natural
awareness. Smells have very real consequences and they constantly feed into Khoisan
perceptions.
Tom Brown's Apache mentor did not distinguish between tracking and awareness.
Ingold observes that learning in aboriginal contexts is not a transmission of knowledge
but an education of attention (2000:167). As aboriginal peoples extend their awareness,
they follow roots of connection and learn links that they perceive between environ-
mental phenomena. Brown talks of the skilled tracker unfolding the tracks and becom-
ing profoundly intimate with the creature at the end of the path. Some !X6 Bushmen
trackers describe how they feel the presence of particular animals before they see them.
When a burning sensation develops in their central forehead, just above the eyes, they
know their quarry is just ahead of them. The feeling is sometimes accompanied by
perspiration under the arms (Liebenberg 2001: 93). The historic /Xam similarly
described what Wilhelm Bleek translated as 'presentiments'.
They feel in their bodies that certain events are going to happen. There is a kind of beating of the flesh,
which tells them things. Those who are stupid, do not understand these teachings; they disobey them,
and get into trouble, - such as being killed by a lion, etc. - The beatings tell those who understand
(1876: 17).
Khoisan ideas have developed from listening to a revealing world. In persistent Khoisan
ways of thinking, wind, as mover of scent and potency, tracks through the air that binds
together the person with the experiential evidence and events of life. Tracking is
intimately tied to how Khoisan think about wind. Like wind, tracks connect with the
invisible source.
The notion of threads of connection inherent in tracking and smell plays into the
invisible world of the Khoisan shaman. A Jul'hoansi healer, Kxao 0 oma, described tsso,
a floating yellow and green string or rope that he sees in the healing dance. The string
goes to many places. Khoisan follow it to the dead people.'1 Cwi Cucga sometimes
followed the string or rode on the back of animals to the village of the dead people."
A Hai//om healer, Gaarugu //Khumob (1904-87), told Ilsa Schatz that when he was
lying as if dead on the ground in a trance-like state, his 'soul' would go up to the god,
//Gamab, on a long string (Schatz, pers. comm., 3 September 2001). Lebzelter reported
that the !Kung god /Nawa similarly moved between heaven and earth on a string

(Lebzelter 1934: 49). /Xam Bushmen spoke of ringing strings that vibrated inside them
and connected them to the physical and cosmological world. The shaman would hear
the string when calling forth the mythical 'rainbull'. The strings snapped at death and
the ringing ceased (D.F. Bleek 1936: 134).
Internalizing wind
Khoisan simultaneously hold multiple understandings of wind. Different aspects of
wind are conceptualized depending on the context. There is the wind that blows - it is
both a normal and everyday wind but at the same time it is special as God's life-giving
breath. Whirlwinds are special because they hold dead people who can cause harm.
Winds of healers, animals, strangers, and people in dangerous or liminal states can also
cause harm. There is wind that enters people with food, particularly fizzy drinks. At the
same time, winds are known by their effects, which give them a form or identity - a
rainwind or a hot person-killing wind. Ingold observed that in aboriginal cultures
causality is personal, not mechanical or biological, and wind is thought of as being like
a person (2000: 48). To the Khoisan, wind is like a person or an animal, and as such can
be talked to and negotiated with. But regardless of the differences between these various
winds, they all have the potential to enter people.
How wind enters the body varies in relation both to the sort of wind and to personal
and group perspectives. Most of those whom I encountered said that life-wind entered
through the nose and mouth. Many included the ears and some the sexual orifices and
the follicles of body hair. Very few seemed to distinguish a trachea from the oesophagus.
The life-giving wind, they would say, enters where the food goes down and runs to the
stomach. As will be seen, wind in the stomach is a commonly mentioned problem.
In an uneven cognitive step many Khoisan believe that the heart is the principal
holder of life-giving wind. In this capacity the heart is home of the soul - the wind gift
from God that bestows personality. How the wind gets to the heart as opposed to the
stomach is not clear. The heart is believed to activate the lungs and cause them to
breathe. The lungs hold wind, but less than does the heart. To address serious illness
Khoisan healers travel to God, who is thought in such instances to have stolen the sick
person's heart and hence their life-wind and soul. They plead with God for its return.
If the heart is given back to the victim, via the shaman, he or she will survive. If not, he
or she will die. The idea of the heart moving and causing sickness has a wider context
in Khoisan concepts of disease. Many illnesses are attributed to moving organs,
although it is only the heart that is envisaged as being taken outside the body.
Similarly to my findings, Guenther observed that amongst Nharo the key organs of
the body, the lungs, liver, kidneys and heart, are all 'kept alive and integrated by soul,
(f i) ... The heart is the central organ of the body and holds the strongest concentration
of / i'. He elaborated that breath, f a, which also means wind, is closely linked with f i
and believed by some Nharo to be the embodiment of soul, which is otherwise an
immaterial substance (1986: 234, 241).
As noted earlier, the Ju/'hoansi think of whirlwinds as //Guawa Za, which has been
translated as //Gauwa smell, although Marshall added that /a 'is not an ordinary
odour, which one can actually smell' (1962: 239). '//Gauwa walks in the whirlwind and
his smell is in it and death is in it. If a wind passes over the person, the a goes into him,
and he will get sick and die' (Marshall 1976: 42). Snyman lists Ju/'hoansi (Zu/h'6asi)
regional dialect variations that include both mn #'d, meaning 'wind' or 'wind with
smell in it', and 4 'a, meaning 'any wind' (1997: appendix 1).

Establishing relationships between different Khoisan languages is a difficult task, in
part owing to the inconsistency of Western orthography and the variation in pronun-
ciation and flexibility of ideas that seem characteristic of being Khoisan. Somewhere in
the /a and fi complex of ideas lies the relationship of external wind to notions of
internal wind, potency, and smell. Guenther has observed that different people have
different t:i which enables them to do things specific to their t i (1986: 242). This
resonates with Levy-Bruhl's ideas of 'form' and buttresses my link between form and
personal wind or potency.
The Nharo association of thought, feeling, or soul with breath and wind was mir-
rored in beliefs current amongst all the Khoisan groups that I encountered. They linked
personal thoughts and motivation, or soul, with their personal God-given wind, which
is self-evident in respiration or life. Continuities were further envisaged between per-
sonal God-given wind and 'God's breath', or climatic winds.
Snyman established a link between wind and smell amongst Ju/'hoansi. This adds to
the complex of ideas in a Ju/'hoan context, but is again applicable across the Khoisan.
Smell accordingly also sometimes correlates to form, personal wind, or potency. In view
of the relative homogeneity of this complex of ideas, and Nharo being a dialect of Khoe,
it also seems quite possible that ai, meaning 'to think' amongst other Khoe speakers
(Nama, Damara, Hai//om; Haacke & Eiseb 1999: 261), echoes the meaning inherent in
Nharo t i. Furthermore, despite the linguistic distance between nineteenth-century
/Xam and recent Khoisan, Wilhelm Bleek's listing of /Xam f i, as 'to think' (1911: 154),
might hint at where a historical ideational continuity might lie, although, in view of the
lack of wider evidence, such a conclusion must remain circumspect.
Guenther's interpretation of Nharo beliefs supports my findings concerning the
notion of God wind manifesting in people as their mental and physical motivating
force. He observes that amongst the Nharo, thought comes originally from the god
N!eri, but, once in the body, it 'loses its metaphysical and eschatological aspects and
becomes the quintessential substance of the body ... 4 i is the force in man that causes
a person to think, wish and act' (1986: 242).
With the immanence of wind in the body, wind or soul motivation becomes tied
to physical mechanisms of motivation or action. Many Khoisan recognize a role for
blood as something that keeps the body alive and moving. Very often wind is tied to
this understanding as something combined with blood or something that runs in
blood vessels that enables physical movement (very few Khoisan whom I encountered
differentiated between veins and arteries). The idea of bodily movement is accord-
ingly tied to movement of wind. No Khoisan I encountered revealed an indigenous
concept equivalent to nerves. A few Khoisan envisaged that the wind moved in the
tendons of the body and strong-looking tendons were thought to derive their strength
from the wind that filled them. There does not seem to be a clear idea of illness
originating from wind stagnating, sticking, or being depleted, but sickness was attri-
buted to the inappropriate moving of the 'wind' of certain organs and what was
termed 'sticking pains'.
The complex of ideas surrounding wind, including the gift of life, soul, breath, and
personality or individual characteristics, stretches further than being located centrally
in the heart and peripherally in the blood. The smell, wind, and breath of someone is
held in an essential form in personal smell and sweat, including the 'dirtiness' scraped
off a person's skin. Personal wind is also frequently thought to be held in urine and
menstrual blood and sometimes in other bodily excretions and secretions. These

physical holders of personal wind become vehicles of personal influence beyond the
human body. Encounters with wind in these manifestations play a profound role in
Khoisan culture.
It is the personal wind of an organism or phenomenon that is envisaged as a
powerful force potentially for good or bad depending on the susceptibility and dispo-
sition of the recipient. For certain age ranges and genders particular foods are deemed
to be sickness-causing because of their potency or smell. They are, accordingly, treated
as 'tabooed'. Lee was bewildered that !Kung did not eat zebra because they'smelled bad',
//'o /'xau (Lee 1979: 233). This makes sense when one thinks in terms of bad potency, or
potency that these people considered too strong for themselves. Namibian Khoe speak-
ers term food taboos saxa. The chest meat of the eland is, for example, deemed sixa for
children. If they eat it, the meat is believed to induce coughing sicknesses. The post-
positional xa of soxa means 'from' or 'rich in' and 'full of' (Haacke & Eiseb 1999: 47;
Hahn 1881: 132). It could well be significant that in Khoe, si.b means 'lung' (Haacke &
Eiseb 1999: 203), the prime organ of wind alongside the heart. The meaning of soxa
could therefore be construed as 'full of the organ of wind' and essentially full of the
wind or essence of the organism. The archival legacy of the Bleeks and Lloyd holds
many examples of/Xam beliefs concerning food taboos (e.g. Lloyd 1889: 23), although,
without further evidence, why foods were forbidden remains obscure.
Possessing the wind of animals and rain
The Khoisan relationship between personal vehicles of smell, well-being, and their
wider environment is well illustrated by consideration of snakes. Snakes hold an impor-
tant position in Khoisan life both conceptually and pragmatically. The python, cobra
and the mamba seem of particular cosmological and epistemological importance.
Amongst both'Khoi' and San there is a tradition of 'poison doctors'. Such doctors have
been recorded since Campbell in the early nineteenth century (Schapera 1930: 217) and
the phenomenon seems to have persisted continuously into the present. Poison doctors
are people who take increasing amounts of snake or scorpion venom mixed with other
substances such as urine until such time that the animals will not harm them. The
poison can be swallowed or rubbed into incisions cut specifically on the recipient.
Importantly, whilst this taking of poison confers immunity, it would be muddle-headed
to think of this process in terms of immunization in a scientific 'Western' framework.
Protection of Khoisan comes from affinity with the snake; with its smell and its wind.
Laidler, a Cape doctor with ethnographic interests, observed that snakes run away
from the smell of'Hottentot' poison doctors. This smell is held in both sweat and spittle
(Laidler 1923(?): 180-1). The Austrian ethnographer Lebzelter (1934: 47) reported that
!Kung Bushmen who are not 'poison doctors' can help prevent snake-bite by making
cuts on the lower thighs into which they rub grated bits of'bisob' root. The snakes smell
the plant and remain hidden. Laidler has more to say of snakes. At the spot where a
snake lives, a cement-like slimy patch develops that can be used as a remedy against all
poisonous bites (Laidler 1923(?): 181). Laidler notes that in 1835 Alexander mentioned a
great snake he had seen which, when curled up, was as large as a cart-wheel. 'Its
presence in the grass was known by its smell, which was offensive to cattle'. If the smell
of the great snake was wafted by the wind it could kill a person unless they immediately
vomited. The smell of men always made the snake cross (Laidler 1923(?): 127). One of
Wilhelm Bleek's informants related similar details:

An ignorant man having gone to dig up shs-iss, is discovered speechless and motionless, sitting among
serpents, by the hole where he had been digging. By a skilful application of sho-iod, the snakes are
driven away, taking with them the scent which had injured the man, but leaving the other scent with
the plant in the hole. The man is ... restored to speech and motion (1876: 18).
The potency that poison doctors grant themselves through application of snake or
scorpion venom sits within a context of a widespread belief that animals, plants, and
people are born or given specific but transferable characteristics; essentially their 'life-
wind' linked to their form. Although the poison doctor undergoes a procedure to
become resistant to poison, there is a strong sense in which this process remains a
divine gift of a specific animal quality. Amongst historical and recent Khoisan the role
of the shaman, healer, or medicine person is perceived as being a bestowal of, posses-
sion of, and, in the sense of s6xa, being full of a particular potency, received as a gift.
Hewitt notes that amongst the /Xam there were rainmakers, medicine-men and
-women, and 'those with a magical influence over certain animals'. He observes that
'rainmakers were said to "possess" rain and game "magicians" to "possess" certain
animals' (Hewitt 1986: 287), such as a mantis man possessing a mantis (Lloyd 1889: 22).
Hewitt interprets this 'possession' not as control 'but ownership of powers capable of
influencing these things' (1986: 287). Both'Khoi' and San have historically and recently
had people who possess or 'work with' rain, animals, and other phenomena. The Bleek
archive clearly pointed to people 'possessing' rain and similarly wind, !khwe. Schapera
concluded from this material that certain /Xam magicians had power over wind and
were protected by it (1930: 180). The same applies to possession of the wind of any
animal or entity.
Katz observed that Ju/'hoansi healers who are very learned are said to be'masters or
owners of num' (meaning n/urn, healing potency) (1982: 41). In a real sense they possess
potency. Katz, Biesele, and St Denis point to the Jul'hoan word kxao when used in
post-positionals as meaning 'ownership' allied to a concept of stewardship, as in the
case of !gukxao, meaning literally 'owner of water' and having a meaning of a person
who cares for a water resource (1997: 16). They add that 'this concept of ownership
extends to many commodities and activities in Ju/'hoan life that benefit from steward-
ship ... healers are stewards and masters'. The Ju/'hoan post-positional kxoa seems to
overlap ideationally with the Khoe post-positional xa, in the sense of being full of
potency.
A notable example of Khoisan possessing a phenomenon, or rather the wind of an
animal, is the ability of some Khoisan to change into the animal they possess. The
phenomenon has been reported since Grevenbroek in 1695 (Schapera 1933: 213). In
recent contexts Bushmen have told of changing into lions (e.g. Katz 1982: 227) and
leopards (Guenther 1992: 86). The /Xam also changed into jackals and little birds (Lloyd
1889: 22). Amongst /Xam, lions were even noted for turning into other animals, includ-
ing humans (Lloyd 1889: 206-7). Such fluidity speaks much of the way Khoisan envisage
a world of interrelationship where 'all objects are considered to have a measure of
similarity' (Silberbauer 1981:132). The notion of possession and movement of form and
qualities between organisms is an expression of how wind moves through and anchors
within a body. The /Xam envisaged an essential wind gift that characterized their living
form. At death it fluidly left their body to re-engage with the cosmos: 'The wind does
thus when we die, our wind blows; for we who are human beings, we possess wind; we
make clouds, when we die' (W.H.I. Bleek 1911: 426).

One of the most ethnographically visible examples of possessing, owning, or
working with a type of wind can be found amongst the Damara around Sesfontein,
where there exists what are known as /nanu aob, or rainmen. Rainmen are envisaged as
possessing what a Damara translator termed the 'rain, spirit, wind thing'. Her difficulty
over this translation points to a lack of direct fit with Euro-American concepts.
Rainmen typically receive the rainwind or rainspirit by being struck by lightning. Being
born with the caul intact or being the child of a rainperson can also bestow the gift. A
rainman has something of the rain inside them and hence they can communicate with
rain and storms and to this extent control them. If a storm approaches a rainman they
will turn to it and say something along the lines of,'I am one of you, do not harm me'.
Amongst Khoisan whom I encountered, phenomena of poison 'immunity', trans-
formational abilities, or talking to rain all sat within a far wider context of potency
movement and anchoring. A host of different attributes or potencies were either given
to healers, like the rainwind as a gift at birth, or variously bestowed through an event or
deliberately transferred from one healer to another in a ritual. A range of internalized
winds or attributes were conceived of as dormant entities which lodged in particular
places within a person and awoke under particular circumstances. Similarly to other
African peoples, amongst Khoisan these attributes were sometimes referred to as 'spirit
helpers' and often thought to be animals such as elephants or certain birds.
Khoisan healers sometimes expressed their strength in terms of how many such
entities or talents they were thought to possess. The Damara and some Hai//om refer
to these entities as gaib(s) or /gais. One Damara rainman reported possessing thirteen
gais, including gais that enabled him to dance and heal. One healer suggested twenty-
one gais was the maximum a healer could possess, although such figures proved highly
variable. Gais are believed to live in particular key areas of the body, including the chest,
solar plexus, and the temples and centre of the forehead.
During a healing ceremony I was given the gais, or wind, of the mamba, and told
afterwards that if I come across a mamba when walking in the bush I must not be afraid
but must look at it and say,'I am one of you, I have the mamba', and with this the snake
will let me pass. This way of possessing a gais is intimately related to the manner in
which a poison doctor possesses resistance to snake-bite. He is one of the snakes and
therefore snakes will not harm him. There is much to suggest that this sort of relation-
ship is what lay behind /Xam Bushmen with 'power over' rain or particular animals. By
having or owning the wind of an entity, wind binds the source and the host in an
intimate relationship. The receiver has the potency of the giver and can negotiate with
them, be they snake, lion, or storm, should they need to.
The gais within healers communicate as either voices, pictures, or feelings that come
to them whilst asleep or awake. Healers describe active gais as having 'woken up'. They
equate this to the entity standing. At the heart of many Khoisan ideas seems to lie a
fundamental juxtaposition between the dead, sleeping, and horizontal and the alive,
breathing, standing, and rising. Hahn observed that in Khoikhoi the root //o, meaning
to die, is related to //o.b, illness and disease, and //omrn, to sleep (1881: 127). In Khoisan
thought this seems contrasted to what is expressed in Khoe as Suris, the sun, and a
derivative sai, to boil (Hahn 1881: 141). Boiling is tied to life rising, grass growing after
the rain, and plants ripening. Laidler similarly noted Nama associations between the
sun rising and well-being, growth, and strength, and the sun setting and tiredness,
failing strength, and death (1923(?): 135, 152). A strong standing eland is full of wind; the
death rattle is the cold, dry, horizontal expiration of life.

The gais phenomenon seems closely tied to the widely known concept of Bushmen
healers working with a healing substance, termed n/um amongst Ju'hoansi and tsso
amongst Nharo. The substance is said to rest dormant in regions of the abdomen, often
thought near the spine and termed variously //gabas or Il//gebesi in Ju/'hoansi. The
'healing energy' is sometimes conceived by Bushmen as arrows and the //gabas as the
home of arrows. At a healing dance Bushmen healers dance until the energy wakes up,
grows hot, like a boiling sensation, and moves up their body. Lee noted that n/um is
symbolically related to n!um, which refers to boiling water, ripening plants, and, in a
joking manner, the ripening of young maidens (1967: 33). Depending on the context
and the aim of the ritual, either n/um, its equivalent, or ethereal arrows are said to be
moved between healers, patients, divinities, dead people, or 'lay' people for mainly good
but also bad intention. The invisible n/um and the ethereal arrows share in wind's
elusive but effective nature. Boiling and ripening echo the generative properties of
wind. There is a collective sense in which each idea feeds and supports the other.
Wind feeds not only into ideas of moving powerful arrows but also into the unsee-
able moving power of witchcraft, which, like wind, is known by its effects. Although
witchcraft is not typically associated with Bushmen, contexts have been recorded since
the /Xam in which potency or ethereal arrows have been deliberately directed at others
for ill effect (e.g. Vedder 1966 [1938]: 88). Whilst such accounts may be attributed to
acculturative influence, there is a broad context of shooting potency to kill or freeze
game, including, for example, the springbok and dassie (Lewis-Williams 1986: 249), or,
amongst the Damara, of a stare of a person inadvertently transferring harmful wind, or
bad thoughts, =/ais, to another person, and having the effect of clogging their throat.
Drawing on similar understanding, some Damara also believe a dog's stare may ter-
minate a pregnancy (Low 2004: 237). As the alive and divine have wind that can
deliberately or otherwise harm Khoisan, so too do the dead. The wind or smell of dead
people, known as //gauwasi amongst Ju/'hoansi, is often thought a cause of sickness.
The notion of the smell or essence of dead people blowing into and lodging within
others has strong parallels with ideas of spirit possession. Anthropologists have typi-
cally not associated the Khoisan with possession beliefs, although the idea has some
currency (Barnard 1979: 72). When one contextualizes the notion of dead people
entering a body and operating within it within the concepts of gais and spirit helpers,
the spirit possession beliefs of other Africans do not seem essentially different from
those encountered amongst the Bushmen. The difference seems to be more a matter of
degree and cultural emphasis than a distinct difference of belief structures.
Anthropologists and archaeologists of Bushmen have long acknowledged the
important role of 'potency' in Bushman contexts of hunting and healing. But to date
potency has not been tied to ideas of wind. Marshall observed that the word gaoxa was
used by !Kung both for the omnipotence of the great God'which he was so mysteriously
able to create for himself', and 'the special potent "spiritual" medicine which the great
God puts into the medicine men, the curing power' (1962: 227). Gaoxa seems to reflect
a wider Khoisan belief in the power of life and the power that feeds through as a gift to
the medicine-men. This power speaks of the wind of life. The breath of God becomes
immanent in people and abundant or of a particularly powerful nature in healers.
Medicinal cuts
Different forms of wind enter the body in different ways. Besides the anatomical routes,
which primarily concern the entry of 'breathing wind' or illness-causing winds, potent

winds have their own means of entry. Winds that bring potency to healers may enter via
a lightning strike into the body, by hereditary means or birth circumstances, by eating
smelly and soxa food, and by specific rituals of 'putting in' gais. As we considered with
poison doctors, potency can, like gais, also be deliberately transferred. Many Khoisan
still treat sickness by introducing potency medicines into the patient. Similarly, potency
medicine is used to give certain attributes to people. Better hunting skill is one of the
most common instances when potency is used in this manner.
Potency may be given to someone by rubbing the potent source into a small cut or
series of cuts in the body. The potent source is usually a part of a potent animal. Often
this is the skin or hoof of a kudu or eland. Making 'medicinal cuts' in this manner to
transfer wind properties should not be confused with bleeding. Bleeding is a common
health-related practice amongst Khoisan, and is linked to notions of 'dirty blood'
needing to be expelled (Low 2004: 218).
To improve hunting skills a Ju/'hoansi healer, /Kunta Bo, related, similarly to other
Khoisan, that one must take small slithers of an animal's para-spinal muscle and bicep
tendon, burn them until black, mix them with fat, and rub the mixture into three small
cuts on the bow-drawstring-pulling arm.12 One cut is about an inch proximal to the
elbow on the bicep tendon, another about two inches in line with the first cut, towards
the shoulder, and a third on the central lateral border of the shoulder, in the deltoid
muscle. /Kunta Bo elaborated that the bicep tendon of the animal is used 'to make the
bow arm good' and the para-spinal muscle because, 'if the animal stands up you see
him. If you come near he will not feel you coming'. It would seem that what is inserted
is some of the bicep muscle that is responsible for the running legs of the animal, which
makes it both strong and evasive, as well as the back muscle, which allows it to stand up
and makes it easier to hunt. The hunter thereby takes in those abilities of the animal,
conceptualized in terms of its winds or particular potencies.
There is some variation in the position of the cuts used to improve hunting skills,
as there is in medicinal cuts. Another Jul'hoansi man, Boo Sakambanda, used the hair
of animals, particularly the kudu or eland, taken from the area where the neck meets
the shoulders. He burned the hairs, powdered them, and mixed them with powder
from the root of a 0 nuar plant and a = nae 0 nay tree. The mixture was then rubbed
into cuts on the wrist and elbow.13
Medicinal cuts into which substances are inserted are made for many reasons,
including a 'traditional' idea of children's sicknesses, leg pain, back ache, and abdo-
minal problems. A key example of a cut made for health reasons concerns the use of
variously kudu skin or eland skin or horn being rubbed into cuts made in the pec-
toral muscle, just above each nipple of a child, to 'make them strong'. Parents try to
ensure that their children are protected from other strong, dangerous playmates who
already have been treated in this manner by carrying out the procedure on their own
children. I encountered this phenomenon amongst Nama, Damara, and Hai//om. As
an alternative to cutting, a child may wear a piece of the animal skin, either as a
necklace or tied diagonally from shoulder to waist. This latter way of wearing the skin
is termed //hobe amongst the Damara and Nama. One Nharo Bushman suggested
they used eland skin in a similar manner for similar reasons. That one 'strong' child
could make another ill whilst playing with them was attributed to the wind of the
kudu or eland being too strong for the unprotected child. The wind is thought to
pass between the children. The medicinal cut or wearing of the animal part bestows
protective wind.

The broad idea of wind of one entity entering into another and sharing its essence,
power, or identity transforms slightly in the context of plant extracts being introduced
into medicinal cuts. As noted, these are said by some Khoisan to work because of the
smell of the plant entering and working inside the body. A suitable plant will go to
the site of sickness because it smells it, or alternatively the smell of the plant takes
out the sickness. This identifying and locating sickness by smell is an idea that runs
throughout Khoisan healing practices. Lebzelter noted that Bushmen treated a poison
dart wound by applying a glowing piece of wood to the body. He observed that
Bushmen believed the poison would 'smell' the warmth and gather around the heated
area. The poison could then be released from the body by cutting at the heated area
where the poison had accumulated (Lebzelter 1934: 47). Ju/'hoansi Kunta Bo, like other
Khoisan healers, knows who is sick around the healing fire because he smells them.
He stated that 'you cannot ask them anything, you must just go up to them and heal
them'. He knows two sickness smells, one like blood and one that 'is not good, like a
rotten thing'.
In healing dance scenarios, once Khoi and San healers have focused on a sick
person, they often try to remove the sickness by rubbing their head on the spot,
stroking the area, or 'snoring', 'sniffing', 'sucking', or 'snorting' the sickness up and out.
The nuances of the procedure vary amongst different groups. Damara rainmen whom
I encountered sucked up a sickness and snorted it out into a fire, where it was
destroyed. These healers danced to waken the rain- or windspirit within them. If it
became too strong for one healer, he or she might collapse or release the build-up by
blowing the windspirit into the ears of another healer. Bushmen healers similarly
sucked out illness with their mouths. Dorothea Bleek recorded that Bushmen healers,
t/o k?au, from central Angola extracted evil by smelling and snoring (1928: 124). In the
1770s Gordon reported that he encountered a Bushman snorting out an evil spirit or
devil from her son that looked like a cobra (1988: 216). The /Xam healers 'snored' sick
people with their noses and claimed to snore out illness-causing entities, including
miniature lions, butterflies, and sticks (D.E Bleek 1935: 3, 5). Often this was accom-
panied by a bleeding nose. In these episodes of moving sickness, the disease-causing
entity is conceptually given the insubstantial quality of wind, which can settle, become
dormant, move, and be moved.
Sometimes healing amongst Khoisan involves an invisible and voluntary and invol-
untary exchange of arrows between the healer and the afflicted. Many Khoisan believe
that sickness is caused by arrows fired by a divinity into people. These invisible arrows
again share wind's invisible quality for moving potency. Unlike wind transfer, arrows
suggest a precision in their direction. A Hai//om medicine-man told Ilsa Schatz that he
sneazed out //Gamab's harmful arrows when he treated people (Schatz, pers. comm.,
3 September 2001). Some Khoi massagers reported that their patients sometimes invol-
untarily 'arrow' them, or similarly that the wind of the patient will go into them. Both
the arrows and the wind must be expelled from a healer's body. The invisible arrows
shot between healers, other people, animals, and divinities are intimately related
to notions of moving wind, smell, and potency.
In the same manner that medicinal cuts introduce healing potency of animals or
plants into Khoisan bodies, the personal vehicles of Khoisan potency are also part of the
arsenal of Khoisan healing. Anthropologists have long observed that Khoisan shamans
rub sweat on one another or on patients during healing rituals. Guenther interprets this
sweat as therapeutically efficacious because it is an exudation of n/umrn (1999: 184).

Another way of thinking about this entails recognizing that sweat, like the smell often
intrinsic to it, carries a person's essence or potency. Similarly, in certain healing con-
texts patients are smeared with the healer's skin scrapings or dirtiness, termed /urib
amongst Khoe speakers, or it will be rubbed into medicinal cuts, or they might be
instructed to wear an article of clothing imbued with the healer's dirtiness. Dirtiness,
like sweat, transfers potency. The link with potency runs further still to the use of urine
and spittle. Treatments involving urine have been observed amongst Khoisan since the
late seventeenth century (Schapera 1933: 243) and spittle since the early eighteenth
century (Kolben 1731 [17191: 305). Like these other body fluids, blood is also exchanged
between people and people and animals to transfer healing potency. It was recent
practice amongst Sesfontein Damara to treat children's sicknesses by administering a
drink of a spoonful of blood from a dog's ear. Some Damara treat gonorrhoea by
inserting goat blood into medicinal cuts or rubbing the body with a mixture of goat
and monitor lizard blood.
In contrast to the beneficial purpose of medicinal cuts, the idea of poisons and s6xa
foods indicates the way in which potency can be not only a healing substance but also
a harmful substance. The dangers of menstruation are a clear example wherein per-
sonal wind is specifically envisaged as being harmful. The dangers of menses have been
recorded since Kolben (1731 [17191: 147). Sleeping with menstruating women or even
being near them can induce sickness because of their strong-smelling wind. According
to Salphina Janjies, a Damara woman in Swakopmund, normal menstruation, //khd/
aesen (/ kha, moon, month sickness) is termed fau !ga, or slow, not smelly, menses.
Strong, smelly menses that makes a person feel'drunk' is termed //ho!gd. It is the strong
menses that can make a child or adult sick. A woman, or her smell, will nii the men,
meaning to 'bite' them.
That there is a distinction between normal and strong and smelly menses suggests
that why a menstruating woman is dangerous might be more related to the extent of
her pain and sickness or smell than simply her state of menstruation. The fact that
strong-smelling men are also known to make others sick reinforces the role that the
actual smell seems to play. Less clearly, in other contexts it does not seem to be the smell
that is the important factor but a more abstract wind-smell. /Kunta Bo related that if
one's partner dies and is buried, a Bushman must cut themselves and put in the plant
!Gube mixed with water and wash themselves so that the smell of their dead partner will
not make others sick. Additionally, he reported that smelling a woman who gives birth
to a child that imminently dies, or is dead, could induce neck pain, pa deh. Ju/'hoansi
Debe Dam explained that it is the smell that goes on the wind and into the neck that is
the problem.
More abstractly still, the Khoisan, like neighbouring Bantu speakers, believe that if a
bird passes overhead, or particularly casts its shadow on the head of an infant, the
shadow or the smell of the bird, travelling on the wind, may enter the child or person
and cause illness. In children this is typically associated with the sinking or sticking of
the anterior fontanel of the skull.
In addition to these arenas of negative wind and smell influence, there is a related
concept that simply being exposed to unfamiliar winds of people can cause sickness.
Salphina Janjies suggested that the increased mobility of people and subsequent expo-
sure to so many different people's winds lay behind increases in disease statistics in
recent Namibia. Her observation relates to the anthropological identification of smell
as a marker of identity and reinforcer of 'otherness'.

Wind and moving organs
There is a widespread awareness amongst Khoisan of problems that arise from a more
general wind entering the body, wherein specific organs become afflicted and conse-
quently move. Amongst Bushmen the belief of organ movement seems mainly limited
to heart movement, whilst many Khoi would also include the liver, gall bladder, uterus,
placenta, intestines, testicles, and the !arab. The !arab seems to equate to the aortic artery
palpable through the abdomen. Certain organs, particularly the !arab and the heart, are
often referred to as'standing. Standing is a way of expressing organ over-excitement or
physical prominence. Khoekhoe women relate that if the uterus moves into the intes-
tines the uterus will stand up. Massaging must be used to correctly relocate moving and
standing organs to their proper positions. The standing idea seems connected to similar
notions recorded by Dorothea Bleek amongst later nineteenth-century Cape /Xam
Bushmen. A /Xam healer reported that when she took illness-causing entities out of a
sick person's body into her own it agitated her arteries. She had to return home for a
massage to make her arteries 'lie down' (D.F. Bleek cited by Hewitt 1986: 294).
Some Khoi believe that if wind enters the body and meets the uterus it can 'turn the
face' of a woman and make the tendons hard. Healers will massage the'spastic' tissue and
muscle to restore mobility. Breathing too much or consuming certain foods, especially
fizzy drinks, may give the stomach too much wind. Many Damara women exercise
judicious wearing ofheadscarves and substantial undergarments to prevent the ingress of
wind whilst riding in cars. Women are particularly vulnerable to wind shortly after giving
birth. If they are exposed to a cold wind and they are not sufficiently wrapped up they may
develop //khas @:oab, placenta wind. There is a variable understanding that either the
placenta or the wind of the placenta then moves into the head and renders the woman mad.
The treatment entails placing the warm lid of a cooking pot on the woman's head. The
warmth drives the placenta back to its normal position. In a list of 'traditional' sicknesses
an elderly Nama woman included 0 oa fgaa literally,'wind put in' or 'going mad'.
When Khoisan massage, they do so not only to attempt to relocate organs but also to
examine the hardness oftendons. This is related to too much wind and functional stiffness.
Some Khoisan expressed an explicit desire to move the blood around the body away from
'dry' points. This indicates the possibility of the idea of sticking wind, although this was
not an expression that I encountered. After many Khoisan massage, they crack their
knuckles, which they say ensures that a patient's sickness 'goes out and stays out'. This
joint-popping fits into a wider context of massage procedures that channel the patient's
sickness out from the massage practitioner and seem to relate to movement of wind.
When the Damara and Nama massage, it is customary to release loud long belches
- referred to as !gai. This is envisaged as the sickness wind of the patient being released
through the practitioner. Some Khoekhoe will also pop their cheek with their finger,
which is referred to by the verb abu. This helps relocate a dislocated organ. Similarly,
some Khwe massagers draw their hands off a patient's body and click their fingers to
release the sickness. The idea of the healer pulling wind sickness out and expelling it
through him- or herself has parallels amongst other Bushmen healers who pull arrows
of sickness and release them through the top of the skull or their cervico-dorsal
junction, or by flicking out their arms.
Conclusion
The Khoisan are known for the particularly inchoate nature of their ideas. There is,
however, an identifiably consistent set of ideas linked to wind that operate at the heart

of their worldview. Like many other peoples, they merge notions of wind, breath, and
smell. The Khoisan face of the wind phenomenon is, however, distinctive in regard to
their concepts of potency and movement of potency. Working from linguistic prin-
ciples, Silberbauer suggested that G/wi Bushmen do not make the structural distinction
human versus non-human and animate versus inanimate. He indeed went further to
say that all objects are considered to have a measure of similarity (Silberbauer 1981:132).
This perspective, which seems pertinent to the thinking of Khoisan broadly, operates
alongside an education of awareness that has historically alerted Khoisan to what is
special and meaningful in different forms of organic and inorganic life that they
encounter. There is a link between the sort of idea proposed by Levy-Bruhl concerning
animal forms dictating their identity and power and Khoisan ideas of potency, wind,
and smell. A phenomenon is known for what is special about it, and that speciality, be
it 'windness' or 'lionness', and so on, is held in both secretions and excretions of an
organism or the effect it can have on the world around it. The power of the phenom-
enon to influence the world around it is conceived as potency. In Khoisan idiom, active
potency is conceived as being'awoken' and'standing', as opposed to dormant and lying.
Wind, smell, and, to a lesser extent, arrows and shadow are the means through which
Khoisan envisage potency, or the ability of one thing to affect another in a particular
manner, moving between phenomena. That all phenomena share a measure of simi-
larity gives licence to potency to enter, merge with, and transform the recipient. Wind,
or potency, is a gift of life that lodges in the body. A Hai//om healer once told me that
each person must 'dance their own dance'. The abilities different people hold are
conceived by Khoisan as gifts, lodged in the body and reflected in the body. The first gift
is the gift of life-wind. A person's wind develops as they participate in a world of winds
and smells and their own wind reaches out to ripple the world beyond them. Healers
can control wind to transform themselves. They can follow the tracks of wind and smell
through the physical and spiritual world and pull and push wind through themselves
and into others to restore the gift of life.
My research began with an attempt to identify and explain healing strategies.
Perhaps not surprisingly, it soon became apparent that although medicine was a useful
entry point and category of inquiry, the edges of what constituted healing as opposed
to other life-enhancing strategies were distinctly hazy. Similarly, the explanations
behind medical practice were tied not to intimate knowledge of metabolic function and
recognizably 'medical' means of interaction but to observations, actions, explanations,
and rituals played out in the far wider field of Khoisan life. For the Khoisan issues of
health are intimately related to issues of potency. Potency is a word long applied to the
healing 'energy' circulated at trance healing dances and to the power thought inherent
in certain animals or other phenomena, particularly rain. Potency is shared and
exchanged during healing dances. The dances involve significant proportions of com-
munities and sometimes people from different groups. This movement of potency has
been envisaged as an egalitarian binding together of people who need one another to
survive.
Wind is not something readily talked about by Khoisan. They do not have a clear
conception of wind as a binding or connecting force but then neither do they
of potency. Potency is a theoretical abstraction for diverse substances and events
attributed with power in the lives of Khoisan. An underlying role for wind does,
however, come out in many explanations of powerful actions and events, including
those that involve potency. Wind provides a Khoisan way of explaining invisible action

at a distance. Depending on the event, different qualities of wind are drawn upon in
different explanations: its ability to chill, overheat, howl, and smell, and to bring and
carry things, including rain and illness. At times wind is dance potency. There is a sense
in which people working together are bound together in moving air and, furthermore,
that wind is deliberately shared in actions of mutual support. At other times again,
wind is diminutized climatic wind or God-breath, 'the same but different'; at other
times still, its meaning and role overlap with arrows, shadows, and personal smell
essence. The multivalent sensual quality of wind and its boundary-crossing powerful
nature give it a 'good to think with' status among the more and less inchoate ideas of
these recent hunter-gatherers.

Le vent chez les Khoisan : chasse et guerison
Resume
Dans son article, l'auteur exploite ses observations et celle de l'ethnographie du passe et du present des
Khoisan pour essayer d'expliquer la relation au vent des peuples o Khoi >> et San d'Afrique australe et la
maniere dont ce phenomene environnemental a informe leur epistemologie et leur ontologie. Il com-
mence par decortiquer les connaissances et l'experience du vent parmi ces groupes au passe lointain et
recent de chasseurs-cueilleurs. Ensuite, en demontrant la continuite dans les relations au vent et les idees
qui en sont issues, il montre comment le vent s'entremele dans la comprehension du corps et de la
maladie des Khoisan. Alors qu'ils se sont largement interesses a la guerison chez les Bushmen, les
anthropologues se sont surtout concentres sur la danse de guerison par la << transe >>. Les observations de
l'auteur suggkrent que cette partialit6 a occulte le contexte plus large de la guerison dans lequel s'execute
cette danse. L'exploration de ce contexte e1argi, et notamment des massages, des << incisions medicina-
les >> et de la sorcellerie, r6vdle que le << pouvoir > conqu comme l'dlment central de la danse de guerison
equivaut, dans certains contextes, A des idees interpenetrees de vent, de fleches et d'odeurs. L'examen de
l'ethnographie revele que plusieurs des associations 6tablies entre le vent et le pouvoir ont 6t& partielle-
ment apprehendees dans le contexte specifique des Khoisan, mais que ces similitudes sont largement
passees inaperques a cause de la difficult4 et de la nature confidentielle des etudes comparatives des
Khoisan.
