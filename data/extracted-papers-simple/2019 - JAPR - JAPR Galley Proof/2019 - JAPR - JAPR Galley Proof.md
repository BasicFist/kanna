ABSTRACT
Objectives: This study is aimed to be a comprehensive review of the phytochemical constituents and biological activities
of Aizoaceae family plants (Mesembryanthemaceae). Methods: This study is covering articles between 1969 and 2018,
reviewed from internationally accepted databases and scientific data from scientific Journals. Results: Phytochemically
studied plants of family Aizoaceae have shown the presence of various classes of compounds including; alkaloids,
triterpenes, sterols, lignans, phenolic compounds, betacyanins, and essential oils. Biological studies on plants of family
Aizoaceae have indicated various bioactive potentials including antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antitumor,
hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and other effects. The reported medicinal plants of family Aizoaceae were selected
and summarized on the basis of their; phytochemical constituents and biological activities. Conclusion: The results of
this study may inspire further ethno-botanical and ethno-pharmacological research and investigations toward drug
discovery.
