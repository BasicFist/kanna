Abstract
This paper provides a short overview of ritual African hallucinogens. In addition to examples already listed by
Schultes and Hofmann in their classic text books, Boophane distieha, Alehornea floribunda, Monadenium lugardae,
Mostuea spp. and Voacanga bracteata are identified as African botanicals with proven or alleged hallucinogenic po-
