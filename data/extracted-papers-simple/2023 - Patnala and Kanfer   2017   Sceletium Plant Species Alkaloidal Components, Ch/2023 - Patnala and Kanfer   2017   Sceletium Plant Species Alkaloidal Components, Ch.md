Abstract
The genus Sceletium, classified under the Aizoaceae family, is indigenous to the Western,
Eastern and Northern Cape province of South Africa. There are currently eight reported
species divided into two main “types” with five species in the tortuosum and three in the
emarcidum type. It has been observed that, in general, mesembrine‐type alkaloids such as
mesembrenol, Δ7mesembrenone, mesembranol, mesembrenone, mesembrine and epime‐
sembranol as well as some non‐mesembrine type such as Sceletium A4, tortuosamine
and joubertiamine occur in the tortuosum type; the emarcidum type is devoid of alkaloids.
Morphological identification of species type presents a formidable challenge, where
subtle differences are found in the secondary veins that branch off from the middle vein
toward the leaf margin. In view of the fact that the plant contains a complex mixture of
closely related compounds, in particular alkaloidal components, separation techniques
and their application to evaluate specific chemical components are an important aspect
which permits accurate characterization and quantification. In addition, the develop‐
ment of appropriate analytical methods for chemotaxonomic studies has provided valu‐
able information to confirm specific plant identity. Importantly, these methods are also
required for the quality control of plant material used to manufacture complementary
and traditional medicines containing Sceletium.

1. Introduction and background
Sceletium alkaloids have been studied over a century when their presence was first reported
in1896 and later by Zwicky in 1914. In a detailed study by Zwicky on about 40 species of the
genus Mesembryanthemum, more than 50% of the plants tested positive for alkaloids. Due to

this large number of species, the genus Mesembryanthemum was abandoned and some of the
species were reassigned to genus Sceletium, family Aizoaceae [ 1 ].
These alkaloids, originating from Sceletium plants species, were widely found in the Western
and Karoo regions of South Africa. The name Sceletium is derived from the Latin word Sceletus
meaning skeleton. The derivation of the name is due to the prominent lignified leaf vein
structure that is observed in dried leaves of this genus which give a skeletal appearance.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that this plant is highly revered and held in great esteem by the
tribes who collected and bartered it frequently in exchange for cattle and other commodities.
Subsequently, the early Dutch colonists further showed commercial interest in this plant, and
2
many plants of this family were also introduced to European cultivation [ ].
The Sceletium plants can readily be identified by its persistent dry “skeletonized” leaves which
enclose the young leaves during the dry season (Figure 1a), to protect them from adverse
environmental conditions [ 3 ]. The specimens of two main types of Sceletium plants: Sceletium
tortuosum and Sceletium emarcidum are depicted in Figure 1b and c, respectively.
Figure 1. (a) Skeletonized leaves of S. tortuosum. (b) Sceletium tortuosum. (c) Sceletium emarcidum (with skeletonized leaves).
2. Sceletium species
Sceletium species occurs in the Eastern, Northern, Western Cape provinces of South Africa
and the genus Sceletium, belongs to the family, Aizoaceae [ 1 ].
2.1. Identification of Sceletium plant species
1
The specimens were studied and identified using the identification key of Gerbaulet [ ].
Based on the identification key, the venation pattern which differs between species is one of
the important taxonomic identification features.
3
There are currently eight reported species [ ] of this genus, divided into two “types” with five
species in the tortuosum type and three in emarcidum type as follows:
Tortuosum type: Sceletium tortuosum; Sceletium crassicaule; Sceletium strictum; Sceletium expan‐
sum and Sceletium varians.
Emarcidum type: Sceletium emarcidum; Sceletium exalatum and Sceletium rigidum.

The main differences are found in the secondary veins that branch off from the middle vein
toward the leaf margin. Based on the venation type, the species is mainly classified as either
emarcidum or tortuosum types (Figure 2). In the emarcidum type, the leaf is more flat and the
dried leaf venation pattern shows a central main vein with the curved secondary vein which
branches off the main vein, reaching the leaf margins.
In plants of the tortuosum type (Figure 2), the dry leaves are more concave and usually show
about three to five or sometimes up to seven major parallel veins. The secondary veins run
straight up to the apex on both sides of the middle vein.

3. Chemistry of Sceletium alkaloids
Preliminary studies on Sceletium were done by Meiring in 1896, suggesting that the presence
of alkaloids and this was confirmed by Zwicky in 1914. Further studies on S. expansum and
S. tortuosum reported by Zwicky in 1914, yielded a noncrystalline alkaloid which was named
“mesembrin” with the reported molecular formula, C H NO [4]. Rimington and Roets [5]
16 19 4
reinvestigated this plant in 1937, and attempts to crystallize the alkaloid as a free base or
hydrochloride salt were unsuccessful. In their experiments, they managed to obtain a crystal‐
line picrate and platinichloride from the methylated free base and the molecular formula was
deduced based on combustion analysis. The molecular formula for “mesembrin” was reas‐
signed as C H NO and is presently known as mesembrine, suggesting that the molecule
17 23 3
belonged to the tropane ester alkaloid group.
Bodendorf and Krieger [6], in their work in 1957, revisited the molecule and successfully
crystallized the mesembrine base to its hydrochloride salt, along with isolation of two more
bases, namely “mesembrinine,” presently known as mesembrenone, which has two hydro‐
gen atoms less, and the structure is closely related to mesembrine. The other base was called

## Page 5

“channaine,” which was described as a phenolic base, and it was also reported that all these
three compounds were purported to be optically inactive.
Popelak and Lettenbauer [ 7 ] in 1967 reported the incidence of Sceletium alkaloids in the plants
they studied as 1 to 1.5%, which consisted of approximately 0.7% mesembrine and 0.2%
“mesembrinine.” The structure of mesembrine, deduced from their study, was reported as
N‐methyl‐3a‐(3′,4′‐dimethoxyphenyl)‐6‐oxo‐cisoctahydroindole, which provided the founda‐
tion for continued studies on this group of alkaloids [4].
Jeffs et al in 1974 [ 8 ] worked further on S. namaquense and S. strictum and reported five new
alkaloids, namely Sceletium alkaloid A4, N‐formyltortuosamine, 4′‐O‐demethylmesembre‐
none,
∆7mesembrenone
and sceletenone. It was also reported that in a concurrent study by
Wiechers et al on S. tortuosum, another base, tortuosamine, was isolated and had a close struc‐
tural relation to Sceletium alkaloid A4.
9
Arndt and Kruger in 1970 [ ] reported three new alkaloids, joubertiamine, dihydrojouber‐
tiamine and dehydrojoubertiamine from S. joubertii, where their basic skeletons were bioge‐
netically closely related to mesembrane (Figure 3) and not related to the mesembrine—like of
alkaloids. The above alkaloids were also isolated and reported in another Sceletium species, S.
subvelutinum, by Herbert and Kattah 1990 [10].
Whereas the phytochemical content of Sceletium species has been studied since 1896 [4], the
reported alkaloidal content has been constrained to tortuosum‐type species only, and related
information on the emarcidum species has been conspicuously absent from the literature.
However in 2013, Patnala and Kanfer reported the complete absence of mesembrine as well
as other alkaloids usually found in the tortuosum type in their investigations involving three
emarcidum species: S. emarcidum, S. exalatum and S. rigidum [ 11 ].
The alkaloids which have been isolated from Sceletium species are broadly classified into four
structural classes. The major subgroup being the 3a‐aryl‐cis‐octahydroindole skeleton which is
referred to as the mesembrine group (Table 1) which includes ∆4 series and ∆7 series based on
the double bond at position 4–5 (Table 2) and 7–7a (Table 3), respectively. Sceletium alkaloid A4
(Table 4) constitutes the lone member of the second subgroup. The third subgroup is closely
related to the second, which is the alkaloid, tortuosamine type (Table 5), and the fourth group
is the joubertiamine type (Table 6), which is closely related to the mesembrine series [10].
Of the above subgroups, the mesembrine type is the largest, consisting of about 15 alkaloids.
The class derives its name from mesembrine, which was the first structurally characterized
alkaloid molecule [4].

The major alkaloid in mesembrine type is (–)‐mesembrine, reported to be present in up to 1%
in S. namaquence and occurs as a partial racemate in S. strictum and S. tortuosum in smaller
amounts [ 8 ]. The reported alkaloids in this subgroup are listed in Tables 1–3 [ 12 ].

The physicochemical characteristics of various Sceletium alkaloids—mesembrine‐type and
non‐mesembrine‐type alkaloids are compiled in Tables 9 and 10.
4. Extraction, isolation, synthesis and characterization of Sceletium
alkaloids
Natural products are known to contain complex chemical components. Hence, it is essential
that active components in such products are identified and analyzed by validated methods to
ensure product quality. The development and validation of the requisite analytical method
and procedures for QC can only be achieved by testing the product using qualified reference
substances.
Several methods have been reported for the extraction and isolation of these alkaloids from
Sceletium species. In 1937, Rimington and Roets [14] described their extraction procedure of
Sceletium alkaloids, and subsequently in 1957, Bodendorf and Krieger [6] published a dif‐
ferent extraction procedures. Popelak and Lettenbauer, in 1967 [7], reported the isolation of
some alkaloid bases along with mesembrine and mesembrinine and prepared their hydro‐
chloride salts. Arndt and Kruger [9] reported an extraction procedure of the aerial parts of
Sceletium joubertii to obtain those relevant alkaloids.
Herbert and Kattah [10] in their biosynthesis study of alkaloids in Sceletium subvelutinum
reported the isolation and purification of joubertiamine and related alkaloids. Jeffs et al. [8]

reported the extraction of alkaloids from Sceletium namaquense which yielded mesembrine,
mesembrenone, Sceletium A4, N‐formyltortuosamine, ∆7mesembrenone, tortuosamine and
some unidentified alkaloids. Smith et al. [15] extracted mesembrenol (Table 2, No. 9) {incor‐
rectly designated as 4′‐O‐demethylmesembrenol and labeled (1) in their paper}, mesembrine
16
and mesembrenone from Sceletium plant material. Gericke et al. [ ] in their US patent appli‐
cation described the extraction of mesembrine‐type alkaloids with a yield of between 15 and
35 mg per gram of “dry leaves.”
17
Subsequently, Patnala [ ] developed a relatively simple and inexpensive extraction and iso‐
lation procedure for Sceletium alkaloids. In general, Sceletium plant powder was extracted
using ethanol by soxhlet extraction followed by alcohol removal and acidification. Hexane
was used to wash the acidic solution and the organic phase discarded. Subsequently, ammo‐
nia solution was used to neutralize and result in alkaline solution, and the latter was further
extracted with dichloromethane (DCM). The DCM fractions were collected into a round‐
bottomed flask and evaporated under vacuum to yield a brown viscous liquid containing
alkaloids. Following the separation of components by column chromatography, collected elu‐
ents were spotted on a TLC plate (Figure 4). The TLC plate was first observed under UV
254
which showed extensive related substances (acetone‐Track 3 and acetonitrile‐Track 4) and fur‐
ther sprayed with Dragendorff's reagent (Figure 4). The acetone fraction and the acetonitrile
(ACN) fractions were found to contain alkaloids.
The ACN fraction was tested for its UV spectrum which showed a maximum at 298.2 nm was
found to be ∆7mesembrenone (Figure 5), and this fraction was further purified by preparative
TLC.
In view of the fact that Sceletium species contain complex mixtures of closely related alkaloi‐
dal components, appropriate analytical methods for their separation and identification are
Figure 4. TLC plate of the column fractions by developed TLC method observed under UV and subsequently sprayed
254
with Dragendorff's reagent for positive identification of alkaloids.

essential prerequisites for chemotaxonomic profiling of these species. Furthermore, the avail‐
ability of relevant alkaloid reference standards is also necessary including the use of an ana‐
lytical method with required specificity for fingerprinting. These foregoing considerations are
Sceletium
essential to facilitate the proper identification of species based on a chemotaxonomic
11
approach [ ].
5. Development of analytical methodologies for identification and
quality control (QC) of Sceletium plant material and associated products
5.1. High‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
Chromatographic fingerprinting has been widely accepted and recommended by various
18 19
regulatory authorities such as WHO [ ], US‐FDA [ ] and EMEA [20] to assess the consis‐
tency of batch to batch dosage forms containing phytochemical components of the harvested
plants. In the current international regulatory scenario, qualitative and quantitative analytical
methods are considered mandatory.
Sceletium
Validated analytical methods to assay plant material and dosage forms for relevant
alkaloidal content were reported for the first time where a simple, accurate, precise, rapid and

reproducible HPLC method was developed for the identification and quantitative analysis of
five relevant Sceletium alkaloids, Δ7 mesembrenone, mesembranol, mesembrenone, mesem‐
brine and epimesembranol. This method has also been successfully used to study chemo‐
Sceletium
taxonomy of some species and has provided impetus for the future development
Sceletium 21
of quality monographs for plant and dosage forms containing [ ]. Subsequently,
22
this method has been applied for the identification [ ] and quantization of two additional
alkaloids: Sceletium A4 and mesembrenol. Figure 6 illustrates the chromatographic profile of
the above‐mentioned alkaloids.
5.2. LC‐MS/MS
Since a number of variables including species differences, harvesting time, growing condi‐
tions, storage and processing contribute to the variation in phytochemical components in
plants, it is therefore necessary to use appropriate and specific analytical methods to ensure
23
quality which may affect the safety and efficacy of products prepared from plant material [ ].
Sceletium
In particular, with respect to the plant species which contain closely related mesem‐
17
brine‐type compounds of which some are epimers and have isobaric chemistries [ ], specific
methods are necessary. Since HPLC using UV detection cannot discriminate between such
compounds, detection by MS enhances the accuracy and specificity of the analytical method,
Sceletium
thereby reducing the risk of using an inappropriate species for the indications on
22
the product label [ ]. In addition, this method proved valuable to monitor the fermentation
Sceletium
process of plant material [24]. Hence, the current qualitative LCMS method, and
22
concurrent application of the previously reported quantitative assay method [ ], provides
Sceletium
valuable analytical procedures for the identification and QC of plant material and its
dosage forms. The application of the LC‐ESI‐MS tandem mass spectroscopy provides unique

http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/66482
fragmentation patterns which facilitates the identity of specific alkaloid in complex matrices
11
and thus provides valuable confirmatory data for chemotaxonomic studies [ ].
5.3. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)
Since alkaloids are relatively strong bases in general [25], they are good candidates for CE
analysis. A CZE method was developed and validated and applied to fingerprint the presence
26
of alkaloids in a marketed tablet product containing Sceletium plant material [ ].
6. Ethnopharmacology
The use of specific herbal medicines varies depending on specific regions and ethnopharma‐
cological experiences, which makes this form of treatment inconsistent. Safety and efficacy
are major concerns due to poor documentation and a dearth of scientific research on this sub‐
ject. The World Health Organization (WHO) notes that of 119 plant‐derived pharmaceutical
medicines, about 74% are used in modern medicine in ways that correlate directly with their
27
traditional use as herbal medicines [ ].
The traditional preparation of Sceletium known as “Kougoed” or “Channa” is a fermented prep‐
aration used by the native Bushmen of Namaqualand. Traditionally, its main use for its psy‐
choactive properties involved a prior fermentation by the Khoisan tribe of southern Africa,
2 3
who purported that the psychoactive effect of this plant is greatly enhanced [ , ]. Based
on this perception, Sceletium plants and their products are marketed with claimed improve‐
ments in mood and reduction of anxiety, when the fermented plant material is used either by
chewing or smoking. In general, the fermentation process involves crushing the whole plant
material or aerial parts which are then placed in sealed containers for several days and dried
17
under natural sunlight. Patnala [ , 24] subsequently confirmed that the fermentation process
transforms mesembrine to ∆7mesembrenone and requires an aqueous environment together
with the presence of light to facilitate such a transformation.
7. Biological activities and medicinal properties of Sceletium alkaloids
The study of the phytochemical composition of Sceletium was provoked as a result of anec‐
dotal information describing the use of these plants by early inhabitants of Southern Africa
28
[ ]. Typical examples of medicinal use have been described in the Ethnopharmacology sec‐
tion above. It can be gleaned from current scientific literature that several scientific groups
working on various aspects of Sceletium plants have focused on the biological activity of these
29
alkaloids [ ]. It should be noted that antidepressant activity of mesembrine‐type alkaloids
has been demonstrated in animal models, of which, where mesembrine has been the principal
alkaloid. The antidepressant activity is reportedly based on selective inhibition of serotonin
reuptake, and mesembrine has a weak narcotic effect [30]. A recent study indicates that high‐
mesembrine Sceletium extract is a monoamine releasing agent, rather than only a selective
31
serotonin reuptake inhibitor [ ]. Zembrin® a marketed product containing a standardized

extract of has been studied using human volunteers for its acute effects
in the brain, and its pharmacological activity and potential therapeutic effect are reported to
be based on the inhibiting reuptake of 5‐HT and PDE4. It is suggested that a 25 mg dose of
32
Zembrin® has the potential of reducing anxiety in humans [ ].
8. Conclusions
Sceletium
Although eight plant species have been formally classified in accordance with usual
botanic taxonomy, we have observed the existence of various subspecies related to the tor‐
tuosum‐type plants. Furthermore, the identified alkaloidal constituents vary between each
of these plant species. In the tortuosum‐type plants, mesembrenone (Table 2, No. 8), where
the double bond occurs between C4‐5; Δ7mesembrenone (Table 3, No. 15), where the double
bond occurs between C7‐7a; and the epimers, mesembranol and epimesembranol, clearly have
closely related chemical structures. Hence, accurate identification and characterization is nec‐
22
essary to confirm the true identity of each species [ ] in view of the close similarity between
such chemical structures. such relevant information provides invaluable data to confirm the
true identity of each species. These “tortuosum”‐type Sceletium species contain mesembrine
as the major alkaloid along with other minor alkaloids, ∆7mesembrenone, mesembrenone
and mesembranol and clearly differ from the other species. However, a subspecies of tortuo‐
S. strictum
sum type, contains mesembrenone as the major alkaloidal component alongside
11
mesembrine [ ]. The above‐mentioned information can be gleaned from published studies
Sceletium 17 22
on plants [ , , 24].
The advent and availability of modern instrumental techniques have provided valuable tools
to identify differences between species based on phytochemical composition. Such approaches
for taxonomical classification of plants and their species facilitate a superior and more accu‐
rate method which supersedes the classical techniques based on morphological aspects.
Although plants have been used for their medicinal properties for centuries relating back to
biblical times, the interest and development of medicinal products containing plant material
have grown exponentially where such products, often referred to a complementary medicines
currently constitute and industry with sales of billions of dollars annually. However, there is
growing concern relating to quality, safety and efficacy of such products where regulatory
requirements relating to the provision of such necessary evidence currently leaves a lot to
be desired and in instances have demonstrated undesirable risks to vulnerable users. Proper
quality control requires the application of appropriate analytical techniques to assess the
identity and quality of complementary medicines containing plant material. Quality control
methods require access and availability to reference standards for each product which is mar‐
keted for medicinal use. As far as Sceletium‐based products are concerned, the information
relating to isolation, identification, quantification and purification of individual alkaloidal
compounds found in Sceletium species provides valuable data for use in the quality con‐
trol of medicines containing Sceletium plant material. While quality control is an essential
component to ensure the quality of medicines, evidence of the safety and efficacy is further
essential components, and it is important that such data are generated through clinical trials

in humans. Furthermore, the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME)
of administered products and associated kinetics should be studied. Such studies require
the development and validation of appropriate analytical techniques to monitor the active
ingredient(s) and the resulting metabolite(s) where applicable.
Modern instrumental methods such HPLC, LC‐MS, CZE and associated analytical technolo‐
gies have been invaluable in developing profiles for fingerprinting, identification and charac‐
terization of the relevant alkaloids and their specific plant associations as well as serving as an
Sceletium
important tool for QC purposes of plant material and herbal medicines containing .
In addition, such techniques are also necessary to study the safety, efficacy, ADME and kinet‐
ics of medicinal products containing plant material.
