Graphical Abstract:
1. INTRODUCTION:
Among all, Depression is a diminishing mental disorder and possibly it has become a major
cause of ill health and death worldwide. It undesirably affects the span and quality of life,
decreases mobility, and also compiled with anxiety. It is a motor disorder that leads to loss of
interest in life and leads to lethargy.
Depression is characterized anatomically by neuronal atrophy and troubles in composite
neuroplastic circuits in the brain. The medicinal drugs which are available in the market, they
are fused with lots of adverse effects and side effects besides their biological effect. In
today’s scenario, medicinal drugs of plant origin are a safe and alternative way to treat
depression [1].
The endemic plant of South Africa Scelentium tortuosum of the succulent family
Mesembryathemaceae has a long history of medicinal and traditional use by San and
Khoikhoi people as a masticatory and medicine [2-3] and after by colonial farmers as a
psychotropic in nature in tincture form [4]. From the last 15 years, the plant has attracted
attention for its theorised applications in endorsing a sense of wellbeing and relieving stress
in human beings and for the treatment of anxiety and depression in clinically anxious and
depressed patients [5-6]. Cyclic nucleotide Phosphodiesterases comprise a diverse group of
enzymes that are important regulators of signal transduction. Phosphodiesterases are
classified into 11 families based on sequence homology, substrates, and regulation by

modulators. Enzymes found in the PDE4 family catalyze the hydrolysis of cyclic Adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) and have a critical role in controlling the intracellular concentration
of cAMP and increasing phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein [7].
This shows a downregulation of the cAMP cascade that can be restored using
Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors [8], which gives an idea that is reinforced by an increasing
number of in vivo studies and [9]. The biological actions of a standardized extract of the plant
(mesembrine) have been reported to be dual Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor and 5-HT reuptake
inhibitor [10-11]. The chemical structure of Phytoconstituents is given below in figure 1.

Figure No 1:Chemical Structure of Phytoconstituents.
Thus the present work targets to recognize the mechanism of action of a few antidepressant
Phytoconstituents obtained from Sceletium tortuosum, an African endemic plant with the
computational approach of phytochemical search, molecular docking simulation to predict
the pocket region of the protein, and binding conformations of ligands with the receptor
protein, validation of protein and comparison of standard drug binding energies with the
ligand binding energies with receptor protein [12].
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
2.1. Data source:
All selected plant-derived antidepressant Phytoconstituents were investigated using Dr.
Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database.
(http://phytochem.nal.usda.gov/phytochem/search)

2.2. Drug likeliness:
Phytochemical components were downloaded from PubChem, and the structures were
translated into PDB format using open babel software and the drug-likeliness of the
compounds was evaluated using the Drulito program.
2.3. Docking studies:
2.3.1. Ligand preparation:
The 2d and 3d structures of the Phytoconstituents were obtained from the PubChem database
(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) in Sdf format. The open babel in PyRx software [13] was
used to convert a sdf file into a pdf file.
2.3.2. Preparation of Protein:
The sequence of Phosphodiesterase 4 receptor protein was retrieved from RCSB PDB data
bank (https://www.rcsb.org/).in PDB format [15].The protein receptor has chains A and B.
Before docking, the protein was cleaned, all the heterogeneous atoms were removed, polar
hydrogen atoms were added and water molecules are removed as water molecules may
interfere during receptor-ligand interaction.

2.3.3. Active Site Prediction:
An important step is a precise prediction of active sites throughout bioinformatics. During
this analysis, the Active Site of Phosphodiesterase 4 was projected (Figure 3) by Drug
Discovery StudioVisualizer (PDB ID: 3I8V) [16].

Figure no 3: Prediction of the active site by discovery studio visualizer
2.3.4. Compound screening using Autodock vina:
Computational molecular docking of all active Phytoconstituents with the receptor protein
was executed using Autodock vina [14]. All Ligands were found flexible during the docking
assignment, and protein was kept rigid. The energy of all Phytoconstituents was minimized in
the PyRx virtual screening tool [17], then these Phytoconstituents were then read as input for
Autodock vina, to get the docking simulation. The grid dimension was specified to
61.3x25x55 and cavity points were assigned to X= 28.198, Y= 11.49, and Z= -19.39 with
score function A. The ligand with minimum binding energy value (kcal/mol) was considered
to be the best target ligand interaction. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of less than1.0
Å were deemed optimal and clustered to determine the desirable relation. To validate the
result of the docking process of the current study, redocking of the co-crystallized structure of
the protein (Phosphodiesterase 4) bound with the inhibitor EH58 into the same active site of
the protein was performed. Discovery Studio visualizer was used to examine the docking site
visually.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Drug likeliness properties
Drulito software[18] was used to study the physicochemical properties of selected active
compounds. All Phytoconstituents obeyed Lipinski’s rule (Table 1).

3.2.Molecular docking studies
Molecular docking was performed for 3 Phytoconstituents obtained from Scelentium
tortuosum to discover a prospective antidepressant drug against PDEs 4 receptor protein
(PDB ID: 3I8V All 4 Phytoconstituents were bound to the target receptor protein and rated
based on their docking results. Top three compounds with a docking value of −8.2 kcal/mol
and −8.1 kcal/mol and 8.0 kcal/moare considered to be a good illustration for depression
control. For a detailed review, refer to (Table 2). All compounds were chosen based on
ligand-protein binding interactions (Figures 4, 5).

communications assessment. Table3provided the best binding sites for protein-ligand
interaction. The strongest connection was noticed in the Mesembrenone with PDEs 4 protein
complexes of −8.2 kcal/mol. The PDEs 4 with Mesembrenone complex formed three

This is a sign of the stereochemical quality of the model taken for the structural analysis, and
also validated the target-ligand binding efficacy of the structure. Ramachandran plot shows
the main chain torsion angles phi, psi (φ, Ψ) (Ramachandran angles) in a protein of known
structure (Figures 1 and 2). The Ramachandran plot shows the phi-psi torsion angles for all
amino acid residues in the structure (except those at the chain termini) which were classified
according to their regions in the quadrangle [19]. The red regions in the graph indicate the
most allowed regions whereas the yellow regions represent allowed regions. In PDEs 4
protein model, 93% of the amino acid residues were in the most favored region, 7% in the
allowed region, 0% in the generously allowed region, and 0% of amino acid residues found in
the disallowed regions.

CONCLUSION:
According to research, we used bioinformatics tools, Autodock vina, PyRx tool,Drulito
discovery studio visualizer 2021, and Procheck to detect the potential of Phytoconstituents
obtained from Scelentium tortuosum plant extract. Based on results we can conclude that the
three Phytoconstituents, mesembrenone, mesembrine, and mesembranol should be extended
for in Vitro and pre-clinical studies as potent and safe Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors to
improve quality of life by regulating mood and reversal of functional and social
incapacitiesconcomitant with depression. Molecular docking continues to hold great promise
in the field of computer-based drug design which screens small molecules by orienting and
scoring them in the binding site of the targeted protein. Comparative docking analysis of

phytoconstituents with synthetic drugs for the treatment of depression such as imipramine
also suggests that these Phytoconstituents can be an unconventional and safe source for
treatment and mitigation of depression. Thus, this can be an alternative pathway that has
remarkable value for drug discovery and the treatment of depression.
