relieving stress in healthy individuals, and enhancing cognitive functions. These pharmacological actions are
Psychoactive
Antidepressant attributed to its phytochemical constituents referred to as mesembrine-type alkaloids.
Aim of the review: The aim of this review was to comprehensively summarize and critically evaluate recent
research advances on the phytochemistry, pharmacokinetics, biological, pre-clinical and clinical activities of the
medicinal plant S. tortuosum. Additionally, current ongoing research and future perspectives are also discussed.
Methods: All relevant scientific articles, books, MSc and Ph.D. dissertations on botany, behavioral pharmacology,
traditional uses, and phytochemistry of S. tortuosum were retrieved from different databases (including Science
Direct, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science). For pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects
of S. tortuosum, the focus fell on relevant publications published between 2009 and 2021.
Results: Twenty-five alkaloids belonging to four structural classes viz: mesembrine, Sceletium A4, joubertiamine,
and tortuosamine, have been identified from S. tortuosum, of which the mesembrine class is predominant. The
crude extracts and commercially available standardized extracts of S. tortuosum have displayed a wide spectrum
of biological activities (e.g. antimalarial, anti-oxidant, neuromodulatory, immunomodulatory, anti-HIV, neuro-
protection) in in vitro or in vivo studies. While the plant has been studied in clinical populations, this has only
been in healthy subjects, so that further study in pathological states remains to be done. Nevertheless, the
aforementioned studies have demonstrated that S. tortuosum has potential for enhancing cognitive function and
managing anxiety and depression.
Conclusion: As an important South African medicinal plant, S. tortuosum has garnered many research advances on
its phytochemistry and biological activities over the last decade. These scientific studies have shown that
S. tortuosum has various bioactivities. The findings have further established the link between the phytochemistry
and pharmacological application, and support the traditional use of S. tortuosum in the indigenous medicine of
South Africa.
