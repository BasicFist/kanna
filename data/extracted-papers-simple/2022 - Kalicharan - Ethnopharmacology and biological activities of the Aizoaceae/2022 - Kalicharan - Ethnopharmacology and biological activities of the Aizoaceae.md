Keywords: Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Aizoaceae is one of the largest succulent plant families. Most members of the
Aizoaceae family are ornamental and form part of specialist succulent collections. The exceptional diversity of the Aizoa-
Mesembryanthemum ceae is not only limited to its growth forms, habitat, and chemistry, but is also reflected in its many traditional

Cosmetics Aim of the study: Herein, this review aimed to articulate foundational and current global research endeavors
related to the traditional uses and pharmacological activities of the Aizoaceae.
Materials and methods: Research articles and search terms related to the ethnopharmacology and bioactivities of
the Aizoaceae between 1940 and 2022 were evaluated using electronic databases such as Google Scholar,
PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, JSTOR, and Web of Science.
Results: Popular Aizoaceae genera including Mesembryanthemum, Trianthema, and Tetragonia are noted for their
cultural value and are key components in herbal medicines for the treatment of a myriad of disorders. Isolated
bioactive compounds isolated from selected species demonstrated varied antimicrobial, antioxidant, and neu-
roprotective functions in basic pharmacological studies. However, most studies lacked reliable correlation to in
vivo activity and did not adequately validate the safety and efficacy of potential therapeutic compounds.
Conclusions: While the cultural and therapeutic value of popular Aizoaceae species have been highlighted in the
literature, there remains glaring inconsistencies among other related species. Data deficiency may be ameliorated
by further studies focused on taxonomic markers, chemical characterization and underlying molecular mecha-
nisms of activity of a wider pool of species to enhance our knowledge of this hyperdiverse family.
