Abstract
Objectives: Plant-based medicines have had a long-standing history of use in psychiatric disorders. Highly quantified and
standardized extracts or isolates may be termed “phytoceuticals,” in a similar way that medicinal nutrients are termed as

“nutraceuticals.” Over the past 2 decades, several meta-analyses have examined the data for a range of plant-based med-
icines in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this international project is to provide a “meta-review” of this
top-tier evidence.
Methods:Weidentified,synthesized,andappraisedallavailableuptodatemeta-analyses...ofrandomizedcontrolledtrials
(RCTs) reporting on the efficacy and effectiveness of individual phytoceuticals across all major psychiatric disorders.
Results: Our systematic search identified 9 relevant meta-analyses of RCTs, with primary analyses including outcome data
from 5,927 individuals. Supportive meta-analytic evidence was found for St John’s wort for major depressive disorder
(MDD); curcumin and saffron for MDD or depression symptoms, and ginkgo for total and negative symptoms in schizo-
phrenia. Kava was not effective in treating diagnosed anxiety disorders. We also provide details on 22 traditional Chinese
herbal medicine formulas’ meta-analyses (primarily for depression studies), all of which revealed highly significant and large
effect sizes. Their methodology, reporting, and potential publication bias were, however, of marked concern. The same
caveat was noted for the curcumin, ginkgo, and saffron meta-analyses, which may also have significant publication bias.
Conclusions: Morerigorousinternationalstudiesarerequiredtovalidatetheefficacyofthesephytoceuticalsbeforetreatment

Objectif : Les me´dicaments a` base de plantes ont des ante´ce´dents de longue date d’utilisation dans les troubles psychia-
triques. Des extraits ou isolats hautement quantifie´s et normalise´s peuvent porter le nom de « phytoceutiques », para-
lle`lement aux nutriments me´dicinaux qui sont appele´s « ‘nutraceutiques ». Au cours des vingt dernie`res anne´es, plusieurs
me´ta-analyses ont examine´ les donne´es d’une se´rie de me´dicaments a` base de plantes dans le traitement des troubles
psychiatriques. Ce projet international vise a` offrir une « me´ta-revue » de ces donne´es probantes de niveau supe´rieur.
Me´thodes : Nous avons identifie´, synthe´tise´ et estime´ toutes les me´ta-analyses disponibles d’essais randomise´s controˆle´s
(ERC) portant sur l’efficience et l’efficacite´ des phytoceutiques individuels dans tous les principaux troubles psychiatriques.
