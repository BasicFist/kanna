Sceletium tortuosum and its pharmacological activity
In the early days, S c e l e t i u m t o rtuosum was found to have anesthesia, sedation and analgesic
properties, and widely used by local populace in South Africa. It was also used as a chew for
hunter-gatherers and herders to cope with life stress 1. Later, Japanese veterinary research
showed that in the case of clinical diagnosis of dementia, Sceletium tortuosum reduced the cage
pressure of companion animal cats and the night call of older cats 2. The first clinical case report
on Sceletium tortuosum described its rapid onset of resistance to anxiety and depression 3. Then
more and more plant supplements, healthy teas and beverages containing Sceletium tortuosum
were available through farm stalls, health food stores, pharmacies and internet sales. These
products are often used to promote calm and health, relieve stress, boost mood and reduce
anxiety. In recent years, study found that it may delay chronic disease progression via alkaloid-
dependent antioxidant or anti-inflammatory action 4. In general, exploring the pharmacological
effects and medicinal value of Sceletium tortuosum are under way.
PLANTING
Wild type of Sceletium tortuosum grew up naturally in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape
provinces of South Africa which generally hidden under other bushes, and a few will grow in the
open air. The seeds of the previous generation floated behind and grew moist with rain during
the winter, while in the summer, its leaves slowly turned yellow, withered and finally died.
When the leaves are green, they are very juicy and can be dried, while the roots can be crushed
with rocks, placed in plastic bags, and then mixed and dried. But wild Sceletium tortuosum is
almost extinct due to excessive picking, and its commercial value prompts people to plant. The
commercially available Sceletium tortuosum is grown organically in the greenhouse and grown
in moist parts of farm 5 In addition, Smith 1 described a rapid Sceletium tortuosum planting
method in which firewood ash was produced on a small fire, placed on the bottom of the sand
hollow, and the freshly picked whole plant was placed in it and covered with hot sand.
EXTRACTION, ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF ALKALOIDS
Many researchers had tried to extract the alkaloids from the herbal material. The methods could
be summarized as follows: The plant material was extracted with ethanol. After filtration and
concentration, the extract was acidified with acid solution. The extract was also obtained by
using acid solution to extract the plant material straightly.
The acid extract was neutralized with basic solution and then extracted with organic
solvents such as ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform or dichloromethane. Then the
organic layer was evaporated to give a crude alkaloid 6.
In general, most studies so far have used Soxhlet extraction to extract alkaloids from plant
materials. However, the methods of alkaloid separation are constantly updated with advances in
instrumentation and software. Chromatography is an excellent tool for the rapid and effective
separation of these alkaloid, including solid-phase supported chromatography, high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and so on 7, 8. In
addition, Shikanga developed a more sensitive reversed phase-ultra high performance liquid
chromatography-photodiode array (RP-UHPLC-PDA) method which was useful for raw plant
materials and commercial products containing Sceletium tortuosum alkaloids 9. Based on these,
Meyers developed a new liquid chromatography-linear ion trap high-resolution mass
spectrometry (LC-HR-MSn) method. In addition to the separation and identification of alkaloids
in Sceletium tortuosum, this method can be used to separate and identify its metabolic
components 10.
Besides chromatographic separation methods, capillary zone electrophoresis analysis was
also a tool for analyzing alkaloids in Sceletium tortuosum. In the research by Patnala and Kanfer,
the mesembrine in Sceletium tortuosum products were analyzed by this method 11. Later,
Roscher's research proposed a new nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry
(NACE-MS) method which is a powerful tool for separating complex alkaloid mixtures in
difficult matrices for forensic analysis of Sceletium-containing products 12.

Sceletium tortuosum and its pharmacological activity
Currently, the m a i n m e t h o ds for alkaloid identification include mass spectrometry(MS) 12
and nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopy 10,13,14. Most studies have used the
separation methods in combination with identification methods, like Gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) 10, liquid chromatography-ultraviolet/mass spectrometry (LC-UV/MS) 9 ,
liquid chromatography-linear ion trap high-resolution mass spectrometry(LC-HR-MSn) 10 and
nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry 12.

Pharmacological Function and Clinical Use
IMPROVE MEMORY AND ENHANCE COGNITIVE FUNCTION
In previous studies, it was determined that Sceletium tortuosum was a PDE4 inhibitor with an
IC of 8.5 μg/mL. The extract, Mesemrenone, was the main alkaloid and also had the activity of
50
inhibiting PDE4 with an IC value <1 μM 16, 17. It showed Sceletium tortuosum has the efficacy of
50
inhibiting PDE4 in vitro. A new phenomenon was discovered in the PDE4 knockout animal
experiment, that was the extract of Sceletium tortuosum improved the memory of rodent species
compared with the control 18. Then in nine cognitive domain test experiments, Sceletium
tortuosum was examined in healthy subjects with composite memory, speech memory, visual
memory, processing speed, executive function, psychomotor speed, response, complex attention
and cognitive flexibility, which, for the first time, proved that Sceletium tortuosum enhances
cognition in the field of executive function and cognitive flexibility 19. In fact, there had been
reported of the cognitive benefits of PDE4-cAMP-CREB (cAMP-response element binding

protein) signalling 2 0 , 2 1 , t h e r e fore Sceletium tortuosum had been well-proven for improving
cognition.
On the other hand, Sceletium tortuosum was also a serotonin inhibitor 22, 23. It was not only
effective for memory improvement 24, but may also coordinate with PDE to coordinate age-
related cognitive changes 25.
In the quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) source density combined with eye
movement test experiments, it was found that in the presence of Sceletium tortuosum in the
positive brain, the arithmetic calculation and the resolution of the α2 spectral power of cerebral
palsy were increased 26. The α2 power had been used to differentiate patients with mild
cognitive impairment during memory tasks, while α2 power was associated with stored
procedures, which increased memory storage and improved cognitive impairment 27-29.
Therefore, Sceletium tortuosum improved memory and enhances cognition by increasing the α2
spectral power. Because Alzheimer's disease also has significant barriers to memory and
cognition, whether Sceletium tortuosum can delay or reverse age-related cognitive decline and
Alzheimer's disease process will be a new research direction.
ANALGESIC EFFECT
Sceletium tortuosum was used by South African people for anesthesia, sedation and analgesia
very early 30, but it was not studied in depth at that time until the extraction of alkaloids-
mesembrine from Sceletium tortuosum had been found to have analgesic effects in the hot plate
experiments in which compared with the reference compound morphine, the alkaloid
components of Sceletium tortuosum, Mesembrine could increase hot plate delay, appeared to
have analgesic properties without abuse liabilities or ataxia 31.
Saura and Valero et al. observed the changes in the electroencephalogram (local field
potential) after alkaloids-mesembrine administration, and found that the reduction of θ waves
associated with the attenuation of δ, α2 and β1 21 further proved its analgesic effect. Then the
results of using the quantitative EEG source density combined with eye tracking on the
psychophysiological effects of 60 healthy subjects showed that the data of Sceletium tortuosum
was projected into the vicinity of another sedative and Ginkgo ginseng mixture 32, proved that
Sceletium tortuosum had a certain analgesic effect.
The analgesic effect of Sceletium tortuosum naturally raised concerns about addiction, but
surprisingly, unlike cocaine, the role of Sceletium tortuosum did not seem to cause addiction or
hallucinations 33, hence it had a good medicinal significance. Then the scientists immediately
conducted research, and the results were exhilarating. The high extract of Sceletium tortuosum
was not only a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), but also a monoamine releasing
agent 34. It played a role as a monoamine releasing agent (MRAs), like other MRAs, for example,
cocaine and sertraline could exert analgesic effects by blocking the serotonin transporter
(SERT) 35. Interestingly, the addiction effect of cocaine and its dual inhibition of SERT and
dopamine transporter (DAT) were not applicable in Sceletium extracts 36. Sceletium extract and
the pharmacological studies of the key alkaloids memesbrine, mesembrenone and mesembrenol
reported that it only blocked the SERT but had no significant inhibitory effect on the DAT 17. The
role of Sceletium tortuosum did not cause addiction, so mesembrine product may have the
potential to be developed as a therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of cocaine addiction.
ANTI-STRESS EFFECT
Long-term life stress can translate into chronic physical and mental illness. Over the past 15
years, more and more healthy individuals were using Sceletium products, including teas,
tinctures, tablets, capsules, and raw powdered plant material to promote well-being and relieve
stress. In the peripheral compartment, Bennett et al. had shown the Sceletium tortuosum extract
to inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis via inhibition of CYP17, 3βHSD and 17βHSD, suggesting
beneficial therapeutic potential in conditions of stress 37.

Sceletium tortuosum and its pharmacological activity
Studies had shown t h a t t h e e x tract of Sceletium tortuosum had a good safety and tolerance to
sleep quality 38. Emerging evidence suggested that the PDE4-cAMP-CREB signaling cascade
played a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles and affective regulation, and Sceletium
tortuosum had been found improve sleep by acting as a PDE4 inhibitor in this signaling
cascade19. In the sleep deprivation model, sleep deprivation for 5 hours in C57BL/6J mice
showed selective damage to cAMP/phosphokinase A-dependent synaptic plasticity, resulting in
long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus 39, while taking Sceletium tortuosum improved
subjective quality of sleep on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) subscale
compared with model group mice and it was safe and well tolerated 20.
ANTI-ANXIETY EFFECT
Sceletium tortuosum was used as medicine and health care product in South Africa, in part
because people had always recognized its anti-anxiety effect. People had long known that
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and δ-opioid receptor agonists have an anxiolytic effect 40-43,
while Sceletium tortuosum appeared to affect γ-aminobutyric acid and opioid receptors at
higher doses to produce anxiolytic effects 17. In addition, the chick anxiety depression model and
the psychological stress model 44, 45 had verified that it did have the effect of relieving anxiety,
but might have some side effects.
In a pharmacological functional study, a single dose of 25 mg of Sceletium tortuosum was
found to reduce the amygdala's reactivity to fearful faces under low perceptual load conditions.
Subsequent connectivity analysis of the emotional matching task showed that the amygdala-
hypothalamus coupling was also reduced. These results firstly demonstrated that Sceletium
tortuosum could play an anti-anxiety role by attenuating the threat circuitry of the human brain,
and this effect may be related to its dual 5-HT reuptake inhibition and PDE4 inhibition 46.
In experiments using quantitative EEG source density combined with eye tracking of the
psychophysiological effects of healthy subjects, the results reflected an increase in α1 spectral
power with the treatment of Sceletium tortuosum. Higher spectral α1 power indicated relaxation
and a higher degree of calm to slow the effects of anxiety, hence Sceletium tortuosum seemed to
have the effect of anti-anxiety 32.
It has been known that when we feel anxious and stressed, the hormones in our body will
change accordingly. Similarly, disorders of hormones in the body (such as glucocorticoids and
sterols) can also affect our emotions. Anxiety is a form of realizing emotions. Recently, it has
been discovered that extract of high mesembrine in Sceletium tortuosum can exert anxiolytic
effects by affecting related hormone levels. Studies have shown that alkaloids can regulate
glucocorticoid and aldosterone production under simulated stress conditions and can be used to
treat stress and anxiety 47.
ANTI-DEPRESSANT EFFECT
Early on, the prototype PDE4 inhibitor rolipram showed antidepressant activity in animals 48
and clinical patients 49. More and more animal studies have also confirmed that PDE4 inhibitors
may be used to treat depression 50 while 5-HT reuptake inhibitors are also widely used in
depression 51. Therefore, Sceletium tortuosum, a SSRI and PDE4 inhibitor, produce synergistic
therapeutic potential in CNS disorders while providing greater symptomatic efficacy and
broader therapeutic utility than the drug itself ? The answer is: yes. Since studies had shown
that repeated treatment with SSRIs can upregulate PDE4 52, which in turn reduced sensitivity to
long-term treatment of SSRIs, allowing both SSRIs and PDE4 to perform better and reduce side
effects. This result suggests that dual treatment with SSRIs and PDE4 inhibitors may be a
promising approach 53. Then this assumption was verified by Perrine et al. in their experiments.
In two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging design experiments, Sceletium
tortuosum was used as a dual inhibitor of SSRI and PDE4, showing reduced anxiety-related
amygdala reactivity and amygdala-hypothalamic coupling compared with placebo which
supported the further study of the clinical application of dual PDE4 and 5-HT reuptake
inhibitors in the treatment of anxiety and depression 40.

Sceletium tortuosum and its pharmacological activity
In the spectral l o c a l f i e l d p ower electron map of Sceletium tortuosum acting on rats, it was
found that Sceletium tortuosum dose-dependently induced attenuation of all frequency ranges to
varying degrees and produced antidepressant activity at higher doses 21. However, in another
experimental study, the extract of Sceletium tortuosum did have antidepressant properties, but
it produced ataxia, which would affect its development as an antidepressant drug 24. It is also
worth noting that Sceletium tortuosum dose-dependently induces attenuation in all frequency
ranges, with a significant statistically significant decrease in the α2 and β1a waves, which are
associated with activation of dopaminergic and glutamatergic emission systems, respectively.
The strong influence is a reduction in the frequency range of δ and θ, which are associated with
changes in cholinergic and norepinephrine systems, respectively, which are associated with
neurodegenerative diseases and may warrant further investigation.
Recent study found that the high memebrine extract of Sceletium tortuosum up-regulated
the vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) 34 to promote monoamine release and
slightly inhibit the activity of type A monoamine oxidase (MAO-A). Its slight inhibition not only
produced antidepressant effects, but also reduced chronic lung toxicity, excessive side effects
associated with monoamine releasing agent-methylene dioxymetham-phetamine (MDMA)
leading to death and other side effects. Therefore, it has good medicinal value 54-56. In addition,
MAO-A inhibition reduced intracellular monoamine breakdown and has been shown to be
effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's
disease and Parkinson's disease 37, 57. Recent reports indicated that the potential therapeutic
efficacy of Sceletium tortuosum for depression treatment depends at least in part on the down-
regulation of pro-inflammatory signals associated with increased mitochondrial activity, and
studies have also found that it up-regulated interleukin 10 (IL-10) release, reduced
inflammation, down-regulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and promoted mitochondrial survival,
which helps to attenuate cytokine-induced depression, as well as systemic low-grade
inflammation. Since LPS levels are elevated not only in pathogenic infections, but also in chronic
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Sceletium tortuosum may play an important role in chronic
diseases by regulating LPS levels 58.
ANTI-EPILEPSY EFFECT
Study have found that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolproprionic acid (AMPA)
receptors have a glutamate binding site and mediate glutamate-related signals and AMPA-
mediated attenuation is associated with successful adjuvant therapy in patients with epilepsy 59.
In the latest study on the effects of Sceletium tortuosum and its four alkaloids on hippocampal
electrical excitability, it was found that Sceletium tortuosum and its alkaloids acted on AMPA-
mediated transmission to prevent seizures 60.
SUMMARY
Natural products are a rich source of new therapeutic agents. Based on the extraction, isolation,
identification, and pharmacological research on the alkaloids from Sceletium tortuosum,
suggestion is given to more animal preclinical and clinical researches on it. Sceletium tortuosum
and its alkaloids can act as PDE4 and 5-TH inhibitors to improve memory and improve
cognition. It acts as an anti-anxiety and anti-depressant synergist as a PDE4 and serotonin
reuptake inhibitor, and also acts as a monoamine releasing agent to slightly inhibit monoamine
oxidase type A activity. It regulates anxiety by regulating related hormones and produces
antidepressant activity. At high doses combined with GABA and opioid receptors, it can relieve
anxiety symptoms.
Sceletium tortuosum improves sleep quality by regulating the sleep-wake cycle by regulating
the PDE4-cAMP-CREB signaling cascade. It also reduces pain-related δ, α2 and β1 attenuation
associated θ waves to exert analgesic effects and does not produce addiction due to non-
inhibition of dopamine transporter. In addition, it has a certain potential for epilepsy treatment
because of its action on AMPA-mediated transmission.

Sceletium tortuosum and its pharmacological activity
Sceletium tortuo s u m m a y b e involved in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, chronic
diseases, for the targeting of the central nervous system. The related pharmacological effects
have been demonstrated by experiments. It has played a certain role in neurological diseases.
The alkaloids of Sceletium tortuosum exerted cellular protective and anti-inflammatory
effects and exhibited effective antioxidant effects to maintain the integrity of the central nervous
system, which may be employed as either a preventative supplement or complimentary
treatment in the context of obesity and diabetes 4.
Nowadays, people face increasing levels of stress, anxiety, insomnia and depression.
Particularly, the aging people are susceptible to have diseases such as cognitive memory
disorders, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease and so on. Excitingly,
animal and human studies of Sceletium tortuosum have showed an excellent safety profile. At
the same time, preliminary human studies and clinical experience have shown its therapeutic
efficacy in anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment and so on. Therefore, Sceletium tortuosum
will be a potential drug candidate which is worthy of further research and development in pre-
clinical and clinical trials.
