Minor Bases from S. Namaquense L. Bolus: X-Ray Analysis of (-)-
Mesembrane Hydrochloride Monohydrate
By Thomas M. Capps, Karl D. Hargrave, Peter W. Jeffs," and Andrew T. McPhail," Paul M. Gross Chemical
Laboratory, D'uke University, Durham, North Carolina 27706, U.S.A.
From S. namaquense L. Bolus, we have isolated the known base tortuosamine (7) and two new alkaloids, 3'-
methoxy-4'-O-methyljoubertiamine (6) and (-)-mesembrane (2) the structures of which have been established
by spectroscopic and X-ray methods. Previous suggestions concerning the absolute configuration of alkaloids
of the 3a-aryl-cis-octahydroindole ring system are confirmed by an X-ray analysis of (-)-mesembrane hydro-
chloride monohydrate which crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space groupP2,, with a = 14.50(1), b = 8.02(1),
c = 7.57(1) A, P = 93.4(1)", Z = 2. The crystal structure was solved by direct methods and refined by least-
squares calculations to R 0.055 over 1 158 reflections from diffractometer measurements. The absolute con-
figuration was established by the anomalous dispersion effect. The c.d. spectrum of (-) -mesembrine, considered
as an axial P-aminoketone, is shown to exhibit normal octant behaviour.

Extraction of AZkaZoids from S. namaquense, L. Bolus.-
Dried plant material of S. namaquense L. Bolus (4 kg) was
macerated in a Waring blender with 95% ethanol (10 1).
The filter cake was continuously extracted (Soxhlet) with
95% ethanol (15 l), the combined extracts concentrated
(2 1) and acidified with tartaric acid (5%). The acidic
aqueous solution was extracted with diethyl ether (4 1) and
the ethereal extract discarded. After basification of the
aqueous phase with sodium carbonate, the solution was
extracted with chloroform (5 1) followed by chloroform -
methanol (4 : 1; 1 1). The chloroform extract was concen-
trated (1 l), extracted with 1N-sodium hydroxide (1 x 400
ml), and washed with water. Evaporation of solvent
yielded non-phenolic alkaloids (150 g) . Phenolic alkaloids
(35 g) were recovered from the alkaline solution by adjusting
to pH 9 (with CO,) and extracting into chloroform (1 x 500

alkaloid fraction (15 0 g) was extracted with boiling diethyl
