Handling Editor: Dr. Thomas Efferth Ethnopharmacology relevance: Sceletium tortuosum (L.) N.E.Br. (ST) is an alkaloid-rich succulent plant with various
mechanisms of action that infer psychotropic effects. These actions correlate with clinical evidence suggesting
efficacy in the treatment of depression and anxiety, in line with its use by indigenous populations. Its low side
effect profile suggests potential of ST to improve the overall wellbeing and compliance of millions of patients that
experience severe side effects and/or do not respond to current prescription medication. However, to elucidate
specific physiological effects of ST extracts, it is necessary to first understand which of its constituents are the
major contributors to beneficial effects demonstrated for ST in this context.
Aim of the study: To determine an anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effective concentration of a ST extract by
means of a dose response in zebrafish (ZF) larvae, and to assess relative contributions of equivalent concen-
trations of isolated alkaloids contained in the effective concentration(s).
Materials and methods: A dose response study employing a light-dark transition test (LDTT) was done in ZF larvae
<
( 5 days post fertilization) to track locomotor activity in terms of anxiety-like (hyperlocomotion) and
depression-like (hypolocomotion) behaviour. Larvae were treated for 1 h directly before the LDTT with esca-
lating concentrations of a ST extract commercially known as Zembrin® (Zem) ranging from 0.25 to 500 μg/mL

and compared to an untreated control group (n 12 per treatment concentration). LDTT was repeated after 24 h
to evaluate long-term exposure toxicity. The concentration that best attenuated hyperlocomotion during the dark
phase following light-dark transition was identified as the anxiolytic-like concentration. This concentration, plus
one higher and one lower concentration, were used for subsequent tests. The percentage content of each alkaloid
(mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembrenol, and mesembranol) in these concentrations were calculated and
applied to additional larvae to identify the most effective anxiolytic-like alkaloid in the LDTT. To identify
antidepressant-like therapeutic concentration and equivalent alkaloid concentration, the same treatment con-

centrations were tested in larvae (n 12 per treatment concentration) pre-exposed to reserpine for 24 h.
Depending on normality of data distribution, Brown-Forsythe and Welch, or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA were used,
with Dunnett or Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests.
Results: Only the extreme concentration of Zem (500 μg/mL) elicited toxicity after treatment for 24 h. Zem 12.5
μg/mL was the most effective anxiolytic-like concentration as it significantly decreased locomotor activity (P =
0.05) in the LDTT. Low (5 μg/mL), optimal (12.5 μg/mL) and high (25 μg/mL) Zem concentrations, as well as
treatment solutions of single alkaloids (mesembrine, mesembrenone, mesembranol and mesembrenol), prepared

Zem (12.5 and 25 μg/mL) showed significant anxiolytic-like effects (P < 0.05). Only the highest Zem concen-
tration (25 μg/mL) reversed the effects of reserpine - indicating antidepressant-like properties (P < 0.05) - while
isolated alkaloids failed to induce such effects when administered in isolation.
Conclusions: Current data provide evidence of both anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effect of whole extract of
Zem, with relatively higher concentrations required to achieve antidepressant-like effect. Of all alkaloids
assessed, only mesembrine contributed significantly to the anxiolytic-like effects of Zem. No alkaloid alone could
be pinpointed as a contributor to the antidepressant-like activity observed for higher concentration Zem. This
may be due to synergistic effects of the alkaloids or may be due to other components not tested here. Current data
warrants further investigation into mechanisms of action, as well as potential synergy, of ST alkaloids in suitable

evident, only the 1hr exposure time point was studied for the evaluation
of potential anxiolytic-like effects of the isolated Zem alkaloids. Equiv-

contributor to the anti-depressant-like outcome observed for 25 μg/mL
Zem. In general, the alkaloids assessed seemed to further depress ac-
tivity levels in reserpine-treated larvae. It is perhaps noteworthy to point
out that - although we have demonstrated escitalopram to not be a
suitable control treatment in the reserpine protocol employed here – the
significantly decreased activity patterns of alkaloid-treated larvae do in
fact resemble that observed for escitalopram-treated larvae (Fig. S2,
Supplementary material).
4. Discussion
The most important findings of this study are that we were able to
observe concentration-dependent bioactivity of Zem and its alkaloid
constituents in zebrafish larvae in the context of anxiety- and
depression-like behaviour, using a light dark transition test. We were
also able to demonstrate that the alkaloid constituent mesembrine
significantly contributed to the anxiolytic-like activity achieved with
12.5 μg/mL Zem. Furthermore, we were able induce depressive-like
behaviour (decreased locomotor activity) with a reserpine exposure

both therapeutic and toxic concentrations as is reported in the current
study, will facilitate contextualisation of data across research groups.
In the current study, the dose response assessment of Zem included
concentrations equivalent to those most frequently used in humans and
other animal models, ranging from 5 to 100 mg/kg (as reviewed by
Olatunji et al. (2022)). These concentrations were calculated based on
the methodology described earlier where, for instance, 12.5 μg/mL
corresponds to a human concentration of 2.5 mg/kg, which is equivalent
to a rat concentration of 15.4 mg/kg (Nair and Jacob, 2016). Thereafter,
the concentrations of the alkaloids were calculated based on the per-
centage content of each found in the optimal anxiolytic-like concen-
tration of Zem (found as 12.5 μg/mL), along with one lower (5 μg/mL)
and one higher (25 μg/mL) concentration that allows for evaluation of
dose sensitivity. While mesembrenone, mesembranol, and mesembrenol
displayed no significant anxiolytic-like effects, mesembrine showed
significant anxiolytic-like effects at concentrations corresponding to its
concentration in 12.5 and 25 μg/mL of Zem. Thus, mesembrine seems to
be the most potent and biologically active anxiolytic alkaloid present in
