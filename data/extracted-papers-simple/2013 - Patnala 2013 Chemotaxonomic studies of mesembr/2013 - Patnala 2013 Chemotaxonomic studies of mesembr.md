therapeutic value is of primary importance for their commercial value and many of these plants are now cultivated
in large numbers to keep up with the demands of the consumer. Proper identification is thus necessary in order to
cultivate the correct species of the medicinal plant which will yield the requisite compound or constituents which
are pharmacologically active.
Historically, Sceletium was used by the Khoisan of southern Africa and records of its use as a commercial material
have been discussed and reported by Smith et al.5 The use of Sceletium has been on the rise as a result of
pharmacological claims that it has anti-anxiety and mood elevating properties. The fact that the use of Sceletium
for the treatment of psychiatric disorders has been patented,6 provides sufficient evidence of its importance as a
commercially important medicinal plant.
Apart from the Sceletium species S. expansum, S. strictum, S. tortuosum (=S. joubertii=S. namaquence) and
S. varians (=S. subvelutinum), which belong to the ‘tortuosum’ type and which have been reported to contain
alkaloids, the alkaloidal content in ‘emarcidum’-type Sceletium species, such as S. emarcidum, S. exalatum and
S. rigidum, is currently unknown.
Sceletium (family: Aizoaceae) occurs in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape Provinces of South Africa, most
prominently in the Karoo regions. Sceletium also reportedly grows in the Namaqualand, Knersvlakte, Ceres Karoo
and some parts of the Western Cape.7 There are eight reported species of this genus8: Sceletium crassicaule (Haw.)

Methodology
Collection of Sceletium
Sceletium is found mainly in the northwestern Cape regions of southern
Africa. Initial efforts to source the plant from its natural habitat in
this region were unsuccessful because the plants are grown mostly
in greenhouses. Hence, the availability of the plants depended on
cultivators. Most of the samples were gratefully supplied as gifts by
the Sceletium cultivators in their efforts to identify and ascertain the
quality of their cultivated plant material. Plant specimens provided were
not always flowering, so samples were cultivated and, upon flowering,
were pressed to provide herbarium specimens for future reference.
The specimens were deposited at the Selmar Schonland Herbarium in
Grahamstown, South Africa (numbers SP01–SP06 for each of the plant
species, respectively).
Reagents and materials
HPLC-grade methanol and acetonitrile (Romil Ltd., Cambridge, Great
Britain) were used for sample preparation and for the mobile phase.
Water was purified in a Milli-Q® system and Millex HV® hydrophilic
PVDF 0.45-μm membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, USA) were used
during sample preparation. The reference substances – mesembrine,
mesembrenone and Δ7mesembrenone – were extracted and isolated Figure 1: Sceletium dried leaves showing the venation pattern of (a)

Results
Emarcidum-type Sceletium species
The HPLC-UV profile of the S. emarcidum specimen showed three peaks
eluting at RTs of 6.36 min, 7.15 min and 10.08 min, which were close
but not identical to the RTs of the reference standards (Figure 4). The
MS profile showed one major peak at 13.54 min (Figure 4) which had
an m/z of 360 which did not correspond to the m/z ratios of any of the
Sceletium alkaloid reference standards.

The HPLC-UV profile of the S. exalatum sample was complex, with
peaks observed at RTs of 5.04 min, 5.52 min, 8.30 min and 9.29 min.
These peaks did not correspond to any of the previously identified
alkaloids with respect to the RTs of the alkaloid reference standard

with the molecular ions of 4’-O-demethyl-mesmbrenone or O-methyl-

by HPLC-UV detection were found to be present in the sample at
0.76% and 0.68%, respectively. The LC-MS profile (Figure 9) showed
peaks eluting at 5.49 min, 7.13 min (mesembrenone) and 8.41 min
(mesembrine), which corresponded to m/z values of 274, 288 and
290, respectively. The ionised peak with m/z of 274 corresponded to
4’-O-demethyl-mesmbrenone or O-methyl-joubertiamine (MWs=273).
Neither mesembranol nor epimesembranol were detected by UV or MS
methods. The peak at a RT of 5.49 min with a m/z of 274 corresponded to
4’-O-demethyl-mesmbrenone or O-methyl-joubertiamine (MWs=273),
as for that observed in S. expansum.

The development of an appropriate analytical method for chemotaxonomic
studies of Sceletium presents a formidable challenge in view of the fact
that the plant contains a complex mixture of closely related compounds.
Hence, a prerequisite for the appropriate chemotaxonomic profiling of
species used as medicinal plants is the availability of relevant reference
compounds. An appropriate analytical method that has the required
specificity for fingerprinting, as well as the ability to assay plant material
for constituents with the required accuracy and precision, are also
necessary. The data presented here will facilitate proper identification of
Sceletium species based on a chemotaxonomic approach.

with emarcidum-type species. Furthermore, it appears that both of
the individual compounds in each pair are present in one or other of
the particular species. The tortuosum-type species S. tortuosum and
S. expansum revealed the presence of mesembrine together with
mesembrenone, mesembranol and epimesembranol, although the latter
two were present in concentrations below their limits of quantification
in S. expansum. S. strictum, on the other hand, was found to contain
measurable concentrations of mesembrenone and mesembrine and
either 4’-O-demethyl-mesembrenone or 4’-O-demethyl-mesembrenol,
based on the m/z and RTs measured.
