Abstract
Sceletium tortuosum is a South African protected species with tremendous value in traditional and modern medicine. The
plants’ mesembrine-type alkaloids are potential therapeutics for a plethora of psychological, neurological and inflammatory
disorders. In our in vitro and ex vivo studies, vegetative propagation and growth of this species were investigated. Cytokinin
(CK) profiles were also explored. Shoot multiplication was induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented
with 2.5 µM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). In vitro-generated shoots were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with 0,
2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 µM IBA or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Optimal rooting (55%), mean number of roots (3.80 ± 0.83) and
new leaf pairs (4.65 ± 0.67) were achieved by 10.0 µM IBA. After greenhouse acclimatization, 45–90% of plantlets sur-
vived. All ex vivo shoot cuttings rooted well (90–100%). The highest mean number of roots (11.20 ± 1.37) and root length
(57.18 ± 3.85 mm) were obtained by 5.0 µM IBA. Although spontaneous rooting was observed in both experiments, auxins
enhanced multiple growth parameters. Cytokinin analyses of tissue-cultured (auxin-treated) and greenhouse (untreated)
plants revealed higher cytokinin levels in vitro. These investigations provide rapid and efficient propagation techniques for
Sceletium tortuosum which will be valuable to conservationists and pharmaceutical companies.
Key message
Plant tissue culture and cuttings enabled rapid propagation of Sceletium tortuosum. Exogenous plant growth regulators were
not essential for shoot multiplication, flowering and rooting. Auxins effectively improved growth parameters.

was observed) with the treatment solutions or tap water.
Temperature ranged from 7 to 40 °C. Growth was allowed
for 21 days.
Measurements and statistical analyses
In vitro and ex vivo rooting experiments were repeated
twice. The number of new leaf pairs and roots were recorded
manually. Root length (mm) was measured using digital
electronic Vernier calipers (model DC001). Root type was
also recorded for the in vitro experiment. Roots emanating
from callus tissue were classified as non-functional.
All data were analysed using Genstat 18.0. One-way anal-
yses of variance (ANOVA) were performed with Duncan’s
multiple range tests to identify significant treatment effects
on growth parameters. An unbalanced regression analysis
was used to determine if treatment and root type had an
effect on the number of new leaf pairs. Graphs were gener-
ated using GraphPad Prism 8.0.

Discussion
The physiological and morphological effects of auxin
may have contributed to the enlarged CK pool (Table 1).

Auxin stimulates and facilitates cell division and elongation

the experiment (10.0 µM). Following this logic, plantlets
had never before experienced an exogenous supply of IAA
and may have begun acclimating to this during the experi-
ment. During this process, signalling for the storage of
some IAA, as well as for root proliferation would have
been ongoing (Korasick et al. 2013; Ljung et al. 2005;
Normanly et al. 2010; Overvoorde et al. 2010). It is pos-
sible that this combination of signalling resulted in slower
mobilization of IAA for root proliferation (Figs. 2b and
3g).
Alternatively, 10.0 µM may have simply been the opti-
mum concentration of IBA, allowing for rapid uptake and

requiring some time for regulation to be achieved. Such a
disruption would explain the slow root growth observed with
10.0 µM IAA (Figs. 2b and 3g).
Despite producing the lowest MNR, rooting was observed
in the control treatment (Figs. 2b and 3a). This has been
documented in other Aizoaceae species. Drosanthemum
spp., Lampranthus spp. and Delosperma cooperi rooted
on PGR-free MS medium (Braun and Winkelmann 2015;
Mlungwana 2018). Other reports have documented similar
findings (Babaei et al. 2014; Islam et al. 2005; Shahzad et al.
2011). Additionally, shoot proliferation was quite successful
in this treatment (Figs. 2b and 3a). Thus, these results most
closely correlate with findings from Agarwal and Kamal
(2004). They reported successful root and shoot prolifera-
tion on hormone-free MS medium.
Acclimatization
All but one treatment (10.0 µM IBA) had a greater per-
centage acclimatized than the percentage of plantlets with
functional roots (Figs. 2a and 4). The major discovery here
was that plantlets devoid of functional roots were able to Fig. 5 Rooting percentage and mean root length (a) and mean num-
