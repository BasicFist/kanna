Abstract
Synapses are the functional units of the brain. They form specific contact points that drive neuronal
communication and are highly plastic in their strength, density, and shape. A carefully orchestrated
balance between synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning, i.e., the elimination of weak or redundant synapses,
ensures adequate synaptic density. An imbalance between these two processes lies at the basis of multiple
neuropathologies. Recent evidence has highlighted the importance of glia-neuron interactions in the
synaptic unit, emphasized by glial phagocytosis of synapses and local excretion of inflammatory mediators.
These findings warrant a closer look into the molecular basis of cell-signaling pathways in the different
brain cells that are related to synaptic plasticity. In neurons, intracellular second messengers, such as
cyclic guanosine or adenosine monophosphate (cGMP and cAMP, respectively), are known mediators of
synaptic homeostasis and plasticity. Increased levels of these second messengers in glial cells slow down
inflammation and neurodegenerative processes. These multi-faceted effects provide the opportunity to
counteract excessive synapse loss by targeting cGMP and cAMP pathways in multiple cell types.
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are specialized degraders of these second messengers, rendering them
attractive targets to combat the detrimental effects of neurological disorders. Cellular and subcellular
compartmentalization of the specific isoforms of PDEs leads to divergent downstream effects for these
enzymes in the various central nervous system resident cell types. This review provides a detailed
overview on the role of PDEs and their inhibition in the context of glia-neuron interactions in different
neuropathologies characterized by synapse loss. In doing so, it provides a framework to support future
research towards finding combinational therapy for specific neuropathologies.
