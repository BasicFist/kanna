Sceletium Alkaloids. Part 7.1 Structure and Absolute Stereochemistry
of (-)-Mesembrane and 3'-Methoxy-4'-0-methyljoubertiamine, Two
Minor Bases from S. Namaquense L. Bolus: X-Ray Analysis of (-)
Mesembrane Hydrochloride Monohydrate
By Thomas M. Capps, Karl D. Hargrave, PeterW. Jeffs,* and AndrewT. McPhail,* Paul M. Gross Chemical
Laboratory, o·uke University, Durham, North Carolina 27706, U.S.A.
From S. namaquense L. Bolus. we have isolated the known base tortuosamine (7) and two new alkaloids. 3'
methoxy-4'-O-methyljoubertiamine (6) and (-)-mesembrane (2) the structures of which have been established
by spectroscopic and X-ray methods. Previous suggestions concerning the absolute configuration of alkaloids
of the 3a-aryl-cis-octahydroindole ring system are confirmed by an X-ray analysis of (-)-mesembrane hydro
chloride monohydrate which crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space groupP2 1, with a = 14.50(1 ). b = 8.02(1 ).
c = 7.57(1) A. ~ = 93.4(1 )'. Z = 2. The crystal structure was solved by direct methods and refined by least
squares calculations to R 0.055 over 1 158 reflections from diffractometer measurements. The absolute con
figuration was established by the anomalous dispersion effect. The c.d. spectrum of (-)-mesembrine. considered
as an axial ~-aminoketone. is shown to exhibit normal octant behaviour.
