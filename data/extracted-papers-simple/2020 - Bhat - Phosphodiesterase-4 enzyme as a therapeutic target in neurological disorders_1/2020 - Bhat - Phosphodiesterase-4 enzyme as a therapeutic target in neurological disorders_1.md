Abstract
Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are a diverse family of enzymes (11 isoforms so far identified)
responsible for the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) which are involved in several cellular and biochemical functions.
Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is the major isoform within this group and is highly expressed in the
mammalian brain. An inverse association between PDE4 and cAMP levels is the key mechanism

in various pathophysiological conditions like airway inflammatory diseases − chronic obstruction
pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurological disorders etc.
In 2011, roflumilast, a PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4I) was approved for the treatment of COPD.
Subsequently, other PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4Is) like apremilast and crisaborole were approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis etc. Due to the adverse
effects like unbearable nausea and vomiting, dose intolerance and diarrhoea, PDE4 inhibitors have
very less clinical compliance. Efforts are being made to develop allosteric moduflation with high
o
specificity to PDE4 isoforms having better efficacy and lesser adverse effects. Interestingly,
repositioning PDE4Is towards neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
o
Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and sleep disorders,
r
is gaining attention. This review is an attempt to summarize the data on the effects of PDE4
p
overexpression in neurological disorders and the use of PDE4Is and newer allosteric modulators
-
as therapeutic options. We have also compiled a list of on-going clinical trials on PDE4 inhibitors

in neurological disorders.

1. Introduction l
a
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a super-family of enzymes reported to be involved in inflammatory
n
diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma (1). A total of 11 PDE
enzymes have been identified and are present in almost all the cells in mammals. PDE enzymes
r
hydrolyse cyuclic nucleotides – cAMP and cGMP and thus plays important roles in cellular
functions (1,2). PDE4 enzyme is predominant amongst the 11 PDE super-family enzymes and has
o
four isoforms - PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C and PDE4D. PDEs interact with myomegalin (a
J
structural protein), which is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles and play crucial role
in cardiac contractility (3). Colocalization of myomegalin and PDE4D in Golgi-centrosomal
structure is involved in cytoskeletal assembly and disassembly and organellar movements
indicating that PDE4 plays crucial role in cellular functions (4). The deleterious effects of
increased expression of PDE4 in different pathological conditions was confirmed in experimental
models (5–7). Clinically, overexpression of PDE4 is recorded in cancer (8), retinal degeneration
(9), acrodysostosis (10), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (11), stroke (12) and in several neurological

disorders (13,14). PDE4 enzymes hydrolyse cAMP and PDE4Is increase cAMP levels by
preventing its breakdown. The ability of PDE4Is to increase cAMP in different pathological
conditions has attracted clinical attention (15,16). US-FDA has approved PDE4Is for the treatment
of various diseases, for example, PDE4B inhibitor (Roflumilast and Apremilast) , for COPD (17)
and psoriasis treatment, respectively. These inhibitors supress TNFα, IL-17, IL-23 expression and
up-regulate the anti-inflammatory gene IL-10 (18). Interestingly, PDE4 enzyme is highly
expressed in the brain and is deemed to be a potential target in the treatment fof neurological
o
disorders. Several PDE4Is are in Phase I and II clinical trials for neurological disorders like
Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), AD, depression, and multiple sclerosis
o
(MS). However, these inhibitors have dose limiting side effects such as nausea, vomiting and
r
gastric acidity that has resulted in low clinical compliance (19).
p
Other PDE subfamily inhibitors like PDE5 and PDE7 inhibitors have shown neuroprotective
-
ability in preclinical investigations but have serious side effects like non-arteritic anterior ischemic
e
optic neuropathy (20) and hearing loss and hence are not a preferred option clinically (21).
Furthermore, these PDE5 and PDE7 inhibitorrs exert undesirable effects on the cardiovascular
P
functions including tachycardia and reduced peripheral blood pressure (22). No clear information
on the safety and efficacy of PDE8, 10 and 11 inhibitors are available as of today and this need to
be investigated. Recently, PDE4l allosteric modulators -GSK256066, GEBR-7b, D159687,
a
D159797 and TAK-648 were developed and have shown improved blood brain barrier
penetrability, high potenncy and low side effects (23,24). These allosteric modulators are found to
have improved efficacy in inflammatory diseases (25), diabetes (26), autoimmune disorders (27)
r
and neurologuical disorders (28). The current review summarises data on the structure and
localization and the role of PDE4 and PDE4Is in key molecular signalling pathways in brain. The
o
therapeutic potential of PDE4 inhibitors in various neurological disorders and the data on the on-
goJing clinical trials on PDE4Is for treating neurological disorders is also presented.
1. Structure of PDE4
PDE enzymes possess conserved catalytic domain (25-49%) with almost 300 amino acids that
suggests comparable three dimensional configurations of these enzyme domains (PDB code 1TB7)
(29). PDE4 is highly specific for cAMP and has a low Km of 1–3 μM(30). PDE4 has four isoforms
4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D that have upstream conserved region (UCR) which regulates intracellular
5

Journal Pre-proof
signalling (29). Based on the UCRs they possess, PDE4s are divided into subgroups such as long,
short, and super short isoforms (Fig. 1). Long isoforms have both UCR1 and UCR2, short isoforms
have UCR2, while super-short isoforms have a truncated UCR2 (30,31) leading to variance in the
regulation as UCR1 phosphorylates protein kinase A (PKA) dependent enzyme activation.
Phosphorylation of short isoforms in catalytic domain by phosphoinositide-3-kinase and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) results in inhibition of PDE4 (32,33). The catalytic
domain of PDE4B folds into a novel compact structure composed of 17- helicefs and three sub-
o
domains (34). Subdomain 1 is also known as N-terminal domain and comprises of seven α-
helices (H1–H7). Subdomain 2 contains four α-helices (H8–H11) wohile subdomain 3 is made
up of five α-helices (H12–H16) with an extended loop that forms aβ hairpin between H12 and
r
H13 (35). The three sub-domains join to form a compact pouch which has 12 (out of 17) residues
p
fully conserved in all PDE families. This is the catalytic pocket and has a volume of about 450Å3
-
and can accommodate a molecule of about 250Å3 in size (such as cAMP). In the crystal structure
e
of PDE4B, residues of the catalytic pocket and Helix 17 (residue 496–508) interact through
r
crystallographic symmetry. Also, the random loop of residues 422–434 in PDE4D2 corresponds
P
to helix H17 in PDE4B (Fig.2). The conformational modification of the C-terminal residues in the
PDE4 family along with the sequence multiplicity in the 11 PDE families suggests that the C-
terminus is involved in the regulatlion of PDE hydrolytic activity. There are two conserved Zn2+
a
binding consensus motifs in the amino terminal segment of the catalytic site of the PDEs, and both
sides are reportedly invnolved in the catalysis. Of these, site A has five conserved amino acids with
a sequence HNXzHG/AX2, while site E and site B have a sequence HDZXHX E, sharing more
r 24-26
homology wituh the known Zn2+ binding site of thermolysin (36). Divalent metals like Mg2+, Co2+,
Mn2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ are needed for the enzymatic activity of PDE4. The number of zinc atoms
o
required for binding is under debate. Reports suggest that one Zn2+ ion per PDE4A monomer, two
Zn J2+ ions for PDE7 (Vibrio fischeri) and PDE4A, and three Zn2+ ions for PDE5 are required for
activation. The enzymatic site of PDE4 comprises two metal ions separated by 3.9 Å, suggesting
its simultaneous interaction with the two metal binding sites. The first metal atom is located at the
bottom of the catalytic pocket in association with the two histidine (H164, H200 in PDE4D2) and
two aspartic acid residues (Asp201 and Asp318) (37). As the metal binding residues belong to the
three PDE4 sub-domains, the metal ions stabilize the protein structure. It has been reported that in
the PDE4–adenosine monophosphate (AMP) structure, the metal ion forms two coordinates: one
6

with His164, His200, Asp201, Asp318, and two phosphate oxygen atoms of AMP; and the second
with Asp318, two phosphate oxygen atoms of AMP, and three bound water molecules. Therefore,
it has a catalytic role (38). The strong irregular dispersion at the wavelength of the zinc absorption
range is reflective of the fact that the first metal ion that activates the enzyme is zinc (36). In
PDE4D2, the second metal ion interacts with D318, binds to water and the phosphate group of the
substrate. However, due to the weak binding at this site, the second divalent metal ion is not known;
although, magnesium (Mg) or manganese (Mn) are suggested by biochemical stufdies (39).
o
2. Expression and localization of PDE4
o
Expression of PDE4 is ubiquitous (40), although it varies both at regional and cellular levels (37).
r
PDE4 overexpression promotes the progression of neurological disorders like AD, PD, MS, ALS,
p
glioma, stroke, depression etc. PDE4 are mainly expressed in the brain, smooth muscles,
-
cardiovascular tissues and are nearly absent in platelets (Table. 1). Intriguingly, expression of
e
PDE4A, B, D was found to be high in rat brain, particularly in the anterior brain, cortex and
olfactory bulb, whereas PDE4C was found to bre high in the olfactory bulb (41).
P
3. PDE4 and PDE4Is in key mollecular signalling pathways in brain
a
3.1. cAMP–PKA, CREB and BDNF signal
n
PDE4 hydrolyses cAMP which play a significant role in long term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic
plasticity (42). cAMrP activates protein kinase A which controls the transcription of brain derived
u
neurotropic factors (BDNF) and thus it has a pivotal role in cognitive functions (43). Mounting
evidencoe confirms that PDE inhibitors enhance cAMP/cGMP signalling and in turn cAMP
Response Element-Binding Protein (CREB) phosphorylation and the downstream effectors (44–
J
46). Mutations in CREB causes cognitive dysfunction, mood disorders and alterations in neural
regeneration (47). Rodents with a mutated form of CREB binding protein (CBP), a coactivator for
major transcription factors, exhibit developmental aberrations like patients with mental
retardation. These mouse models also suffer from memory dysfunction (48).
Rolipram is reported to improve long-term memory and CREB signalling instigated by CBP
mutations (49). It also promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampal region and enhances the
neuronal survival via cAMP/CREB signalling (50,51). Rolipram administered with imipramine
7

Journal Pre-proof
significantly increased the level of CREB and BDNF in the cortex and hippocampal regions of rats
(52). Activation of cAMP/CREB/BDNF signalling by rolipram is shown to exert antidepressant-
like effects (53). On the other hand, receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), called as guanine
nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-like 1 (GNB2L1) is tightly linked to cAMP/PKA
pathway (54). RACK1 interacts (inhibits) with PDE4D5 and stimulates cAMP/PKA pathway (55).
Activation of cAMP/PKA pathway in the hippocampal neurons dissociates RACK1 from NMDA-
receptors allowing channels activity (56) which corroborates with its involvemfent in memory
o
functions.
3.2. NO/cGMP/PKG pathway
o
Nitric oxide (NO) signalling is extensively involved in synaptic plrasticity and cognitive functions
(57). NO is a soluble gas formed by the transformation of L-aprginine to L-citrulline in the presence
of Ca2+regulated enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO plays pivotal role at pre- and post-
-
synapses. NO plays major effects in the hippocampus, cerebellum and lateral nucleus of the
e
amygdala which are critical for memory formation (58,59). One immediate downstream effector
r
of NO is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) (60), which is responsible for cGMP synthesis and
P
activation of cGMP dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG, in turn, mobilises presynaptic vesicles
and facilitate the release of neurotrans mitters. It also activates postsynaptic PKG signalling leading
l
to the activation of transcription factors that are important for LTP and memory formation (59,61).
a
Pharmacological activation of NO/cGMP/PKG signalling is shown to enhance memory.
n
Phosphodiesterase enzymes impede the signal transduction by affecting the second messengers
like cAMP and crGMP (42). Stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate (NMDA)
u
receptors activates NO synthase and increases cGMP levels (65). Inhibiting the breakdown of
cGMP woith a specific PDE2 inhibitor (Bay 60-7550) is shown to improve memory consolidation
in MK801-induced memory deficits in mice (66). Preclinical studies have shown that PDE5
J
inhibitors increase NO/cGMP/PKG signalling in turn synaptic plasticity and cognitive
performance in rodents (67,68). Zaprinast, a PDE5 inhibitor blocks cGMP specific
phosphodiesterase and activates cGMP and cGMP-dependent ion channels, thereby potentiates
calcium entry into presynaptic terminals and neurotransmitter release (69). Similarly, PDE5
inhibition with KJH-1002 was shown to improve cognitive function via activation of CREB signal
in scopolamine intoxicated rats (70). Inhibition of PDE4 with rolipram elicited anxiolytic effects

through activation of cAMP/CREB/BDNF signalling (53). These data indicate the PDE enzymes
influence NO/cGMP/PKG pathway and elicits beneficial effects in brain disorders.
3.3. MAPK-ERK signal
The role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in synaptic plasticity and
memory is well-established (71,72). Activation of ERK signalling enhances LTP (73,74).
Furthermore, both cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and MAPK/ ERK are found to interact
with each other (75). PDE4 is a common link between cAMP/CREB/BDNF andf ERK signalling
o
pathways in mediating memory. Inhibition of PDE4 enzymes by epidermal growth factor (EGF)
via ERK activation increases cAMP levels (76). Crosstalk between cAMP and ERK signalling in
o
hippocampal cornu ammonis-1(CA1) region is shown to be involved in synaptic plasticity (77,78).
r
MAPK pathway activates CREB via p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) (79). Administration of
p
MAPK and PKA inhibitors is shown to inhibit CREB phosphorylation. This suggests that MAPK-
-
PKA pathways are involved in CREB function (80). Inhibition of MAPK/ ERK signalling is found
e
to produce cognitive deficits and reduce hippocampal synaptic plasticity (72). ERK signalling
affects PDE4 activity in neuronal cells (81). PDrE4 inhibition by rolipram reverses ERK inhibition
P
induced memory deficits in rats (74). Activation of NMDA receptors is a pre-requisite for LTP
induction which is primarily mediated through MAPK (82). AP5, a NMDA receptors antagonist
blocks the effects of rolipram on LlTP (83). This shows that rolipram potentially trigger NMDA
a
receptors mediated MAPK/ERK pathway and causes phosphorylation of CREB (84). Rolipram is
reported to block MAPnK signalling cascade by PKA initiated inhibition of Raf-1 activity (85).
Furthermore, cAMP activates ERK via stimulation of B-Raf (86). Thus, inhibitors of PDEs have
r
potential benuefits in modulating the MAPK-ERK-CREB cascade primarily by cAMP and by
altering changing NMDA receptor functions.
o
4. PDE4 inhibitors and neuroplasticity
J
Neuroplasticity is the capacity of neuronal cells to rewire or reorganize the structure and functions
in normal or diseased state (87). Newer connections are established by normal cells which takes
functional role of damaged neurons (88). Clinical and animal studies confirm that plasticity of
brain is the main mechanism by which functional connectivity is restored after an injury (89).
Multiple targets are shown to improve neuroplasticity, cAMP is one of them (90). Dysregulation
of cAMP-PKA-CREB and cAMP-ERK1/2-CREB signalling cascades is linked to disruption of
9

## Page 11

Journal Pre-proof
neuroplasticity (91). cAMP/ PKA/CREB signalling regulates the transcription of BDNF which
plays a vital role in the maintenance of hippocampal LTP (92,93). Upregulation of BDNF also
accelerates neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (94).
PDE4 hydrolyses cAMP and all the three isoforms (PDEA, B, D) are shown to inhibit
neuroplasticity. PDE4 isoforms are highly expressed in cortex, hippocampus and amygdala (95).
PDE4A5 is shown to reduce LTP and dendritic spine number and morphology in CA1 region of
f
hippocampus due to the degradation of cAMP (96). Neuronal cell proliferation in dentate gyrus
o
region of hippocampus is observed in PDE4A knockout mice (97). Inhibition of PDE4 is
o
considered to be an ideal strategy in repairing the deficits in synaptic plasticity (98,99). PDE4
inhibition is shown to improve hippocampal LTP and dendritic rspines density by activation of
cAMP/PKA/CREB/BDNF signal (100,101). Rolipram is shopwn enhance the neural progenitor cell
production in dentate gyrus region (102). Inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines release by
-
PDE4I is linked to enhanced neuroplasticity. Mutation in PDE4 reduce the levels of interleukin-1-
e
beta (IL-1β), TNF-α, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and
r
increase the expression of pCREB and BDNF in the hippocampal region of amyloidβ-42 injected
P
mice (103). Interestingly, FFPM, a PDE4 inhibitor, exerts dual action viz activation of PKA,
BDNF and CREB phosphorylation an d simultaneously reduced NF-κB, p65, inducible nitric oxide
l
synthase (iNOS), TNF-α and IL-1β levels in hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice as well as
a
in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) injected mice (99,104). Roflumilast prevents primary blast-induced
n
deficits in synaptic plasticity and increases the expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazole propionirc acid receptor (AMPA)-glutamate receptor1(GluR1) (total and pGluR1-
u
Ser831), and pStargazin-Ser239/240, and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) that play a key
role in oLTP (101). PDE4 inhibition with Rolipram facilitates synaptic plasticity by activating
cAMP/PKA/MAPK/CREB pathway and LTP in hippocampus of MK801, a non-competitive
J
NMDA receptor antagonist of NMDA, intoxicated animals (105).
5. PDE4 as a therapeutic target in neurological disorders
Phosphodiesterase have a pivotal role in neuronal functions and survival (42,106). PDEs hydrolyze
cAMP and cGMP and decrease the levels of these secondary messengers are corroborated for
cognitive decline, and progression of AD, PD, psychosis, and depression. Thus inhibition of
PDE4 appear as potential target in the treatment of neurological disorders (44,107).

6.1 Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with progressive cognitive decline (108).
AD is distinguished by an increase in the accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) neurofibrillary
tangles (NFT), senile plaques which are made of Aβ peptide derived from amyloid precursor
protein (APP) (108). -secretase enzymes cleave APP and produces insoluble β-amyloid protein
which accumulates and forms plaques in the brain (109). NFT are faggregates of
o
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Accumulation of Aβ, NFT and senile plaques inhibits LTP,
disrupts the neuronal transport and ultimately leads to neuronalo death (110). In addition,
intracellular accumulation of Aβ decreases dendritic spine density and morphological alterations
r
(111,112). Interestingly, cAMP and cGMP are shown to impact Aβ production by governing the
p
conversion of the immature N-glycosylated APP, confined in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
-
apparatus, into the matured N- O-glycosylated protein (113). An increase in PDE4A and PDE4B
e
expression are observed in the early stages of AD (114). Age related increase in cAMP dependent
r
PKA plays a significant role in phosphorylation of tau in monkeys (115). Decreased levels of
P
cAMP/ PKA/CREB have been found in the AD post-mortem brains (116–118). Inhibition of PDE4
enzymes improves long term potentiation, synaptic plasticity and corrects the memory deficits in
double-transgenic mice having a hilgh load of Aβ42 levels (119). FCPR03 is a novel PDE4 inhibits
a
pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and improves the levels of cAMP in BV-
2 microglial cells exponsed to lipopolysaccharide exposed and in mice. This anti-inflammatory
activity is mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling pathway and NF-κB inhibition (99).
r
PDE4 inhibituion with rolipram enhances hippocampal LTP, and improve memory in contextual
fear conditioning test in transgenic mice by stabilizing the synaptic circuitry and via
o
cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling (119). Dendritic spine loss and dystrophic neurites in hippocampal
J
regions of APP/PS1 transgenic mice which classically mimics postmortem changes in AD brains.
Rolipram treatment increased dendritic spines in the hippocampal region of APP/PS1 mouse
model of AD (120). It also produced a dose dependent increase in hippocampal CREB levels and
cognitive function in Aβ injected animals (121). Notably, it promotes proteasome activity and tau

PDE4D by D159687 and D159797, two allosteric PDE4D inhibitors, has been shown to improve
the retrieval process in female Cynomolgus Monkeys (124). These data indicate the PDE4 is linked
directly or indirectly in the regulation of key AD proteins like A, tau and NFT,
cAMP/PKA/CREB signal and LTP that are involved in memory. In addition, PDE4 is also noted
to play crucial role on dendritic spine morphology and numbers. Thus, PDE4 inhibitors might be
beneficial in AD treatment.

6.2. Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease charaocterized by decreased levels
of dopamine and accumulation of -synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra and striatal region
r
of brain (125–129). Sufficient evidence confirm the disruption of cyclic nucleotide signalling
p
contributes to striatal dysfunction (130–132). Downregulation of CREB and neurotrophic factors
-
like BDNF, nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in
e
substantia nigra (130) is well documented. An increase in the levels of cAMP has been reported to
r
reduce the neuroinflammation by downregulating the expression of NF-κB and iNOS production
P
(133). Pre-clinical and clinical studies have confirmed that PDE4 inhibitors appear to be promising
drugs in the treatment of PD (130,134–136). FCPR16, a PDE4 inhibitor, prevents the
dopaminergic loss by inhibiting realctive oxygen species production and preventing any change in
a
the mitochondrial membrane potential in human neuroblastoma cells. This effect is reported to be
n
mediated by cAMP/PKA/CREB and Epac/Akt signalling pathways (137). FCPR16 has also been
found to trigger autophagy in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) intoxicated human
r
neuroblastomua cells (SH-SY5Y cells) via 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway
(138). XT-44 (1-n-butyl-3-n-propylxanthine), a PDE4 inhibitor increase the reuptake of DA and
o
improve the intracellular dopamine levels in rat mesencephalic neurons. This protective effect was
J
found to be mediated via cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway (139). Rolipram increases tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) phosphorylation and dopamine levels by increasing dopamine synthesis in the
striatum without altering the dopamine release. Again, this action is found to be mediated via
cAMP/PKA signalling (140). In addition, rolipram increased the striatal dopamine levels by
preventing its metabolism and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxicated C57BL/6 mice. Importantly, rolipram treatment improves
the level of dopamine and alleviates the severity of Parkinsonism in a double-blind trial (141). On

a different note, ibudilast, PDE4 inhibitor, is reported to protect the astrocytes by inhibiting the
release of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation, and nuclear condensation in hydrogen peroxide
(H O ) reperfusion rat model. The increase in cGMP levels through PDE inhibition is linked to the
2 2
observed protection (142). These data indicate the crucial involvement PDE in pathology including
-syn accumulation, TH and dopamine turn over. Hence, PDE4 inhibition can be a potential option
the management of PD (Fig.3).

6.3. Multiple sclerosis
o
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic neuroinflammation
and demyelination which destroys oligodendrocytes, axons, and rneurons. Inflammatory lesions
found in white and grey matter are caused by over-activationp of autoreactive T-cells and activated
macrophages and microglia which form focal demyelinating plaques (143). Pro-inflammatory
-
cytokines such as Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), TNF-eα, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (IL-12),
and Interleukin-23 (IL-23) have been detected in post-mortem brains of MS patients (144) and in
r
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS (144,145). Pro-inflammatory
P
mediators damage myelin and oligodendrocyte and disrupt the blood brain barrier (146). cAMP is
recognized as a significant player in controlling the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
l
(147). Decreased levels of caAMP in the cerebrospinal fluid are linked to demyelination in MS
patients (148). cAMP analogues are also reported to reduce inflammation and apoptosis. Previous
n
studies have confirmed that cAMP analogue, Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, performs myelin repair in
MS through recruitmrent of endogenous neural stem cells and their differentiation (149). Increasing
u
cAMP levels through PDE4 inhibition suppresses the immune response and increases
remyelionation (150,151). PDE4 inhibition supresses monocytes, macrophages , and cytokine
secretion and proliferation of type 1 T helper cells specific to the myelin basic protein (152).
J
Rolipram decreases TNF-α levels in J774 mouse macrophage cell line by increasing the expression
of MAPK phosphatase-1(153) and by inhibiting NF-κB complexes in LPS intoxicated human
chorionic cells PDE4 inhibition with rolipram reduced inflammation, demyelination and delayed
onset of clinical signs in EAE rodent model of MS (154,155).Notably, rolipram prevents the
development of clinical signs, demyelination and inflammation in marmosets (small monkeys)
injected with human white matter, a gold standard model of EAE (156). Ibudilast is found to delay
the onset of disease and inflammatory infiltration in EAE induced Dark August rats by increasing
13

## Page 15

Journal Pre-proof
cAMP levels (157). BBB022, a PDE4 inhibitor, in combination with rolipram decreases the
severity of EAE and stabilizes the blood brain barrier in EAE induced MS (158). Clinical trials are
underway investigating the efficacy of PDE4 inhibitors in MS (23). Preclinical and clinical
evidence clearly indicate that PDE participates in autoimmune function, cytokine release and
demyelination. Further, few molecules under clinical trials indicate potential of PDE4 inhibition
in MS treatment.

6.4. Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric illness characterized by delusions, hallucinations,
o
disorganized speech or behaviour, and impaired cognitive ability. The precise cause of
r
schizophrenia is still not clear. However, the imbalance in neurochemicals such as dopamine ,
p
serotonin, and glutamate in brain are observed in schizophrenia patients (159). Recent studies have
-
provided evidence on the possible role of PDE4 in schizophrenia (159–161). It has been reported
e
that disrupted in PDE4B gene cause schizophrenia in two patients (162). Overexpression of
PDE4B gene is shown to increase the risk ofr schizophrenia in the Scottish population (163).
P
PDE4B associates with disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a genetic factor responsible for
schizophrenia and related mental disorders (162). PDE4 with DISC1 and NDE1 or NDEL1
complexing suggests additional rolle of PDE4 in modulating cAMP levels via PKA and synaptic
a
transmission. This reveals that PDE4 is a prime target in mental illness in schizophrenia research
(164). Clapcote et al., n(2007) found that production of two strains of DISC1-mutant mice with
impaired affinity to PDE4B exhibit either schizophrenia or depression (165). Animal studies have
r
given ample euvidences on the possible role of PDE4 in schizophrenia (165). Rolipram is shown to
antagonize the effects of phencyclidine and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and to reduce
o
methamphetamine-induced hyper-locomotion (166). It also reverses amphetamine-disrupted
auJditory sensory processing and prepulse inhibition (167) and NMDAR antagonist-induced
deficits in latent inhibition (168). Roflumilast improves verbal learning and modulates the frontal
brain area in schizophrenic patients. The improvement in memory, measured with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is linked to the increase in cAMP levels and LTP (44,161).
Thus, PDE4 inhibitors like rolipram and roflumilast possess antipsychotic-like properties and are
interesting molecules for further research in schizophrenia.

6.5. Depression
Depression, the most common mental illness that severely limits psychosocial functioning and
diminishes life quality (169). Enormous evidence suggests that there is a dysfunction of cAMP
signalling in depressive patients (170–172). 1 and 2- adrenergic receptors produce anti-
depressant like effects (173,174) and are shown to increase the formation of cAMP through
adenylyl cyclase stimulation in brain (175). 1 and 2 receptors form complexes with PDEs, but
their binding varies in terms of PDE4D splice variant recruited at the receptorf. β1- adrenergic
o
receptor preferentially associates with PDE4D8 whilst β2/β-arrestin complex has higher affinity
to PDE4D5 (176). Zhang et al., (2005) demonstrated that PDE4 inhibiotion produced an “additive”
anti-depressant effect when administered along with dobutamine, 1 agonist in rats. Similarly, a
r
synergistic was observed when administered clenbuterol, 2-p agonist, in rats. Though many studies
reveal that 2 mediated cAMP signalling and antidepressant effects are more sensitive to PDE4
-
inhibition, still -1 mediated noradrenergic anti-depressant effect has equal importance due to the
e
greater sensitivity for the endogenous norepinephrine (177). Although, the interaction between -
r
adrenergic stimulation and PDE4 inhibition show prominent opportunity in depression research,
P
involvement of cardiovascular risks hinders clinical investigation. On the other hand,
administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor along with rolipram, produced showed
l
significant behavioural improavement in major depressive disorder patients (178), which indicate
the PDE association with serotonergic system in brain.
n
Upregulation of PDE4 was observed the depressive rat cortex region (179–181). Surprisingly,
decreased cAMP-PrKA-CREB and cAMP-ERK1/2-CREB signalling and loss of dendritic spines
u
are also observed in experimental depressive rodents (180). On a separate report, Fujita et al
(2017) oprovide evidence on the decrease in cAMP levels in living depressive patients (178).
Inhibition of PDE4 increases the level of cAMP, pCREB and has been reported to promote
J
hippocampal neurogenesis which is corroborated to antidepressant-like effect (53,182). Clinical
trials are underway to unravel the efficacy of PDE4 inhibitors in depression.
6.6. Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease is a neurological disorder caused by an increase in polyglutamine (polyQ)
repeated inside the Huntingtin (Htt) protein. This mutant Huntingtin (Htt) protein with extended
polyQ upon expression generates inclusion bodies (IBs), causes increased cellular toxicity and
15

## Page 17

Journal Pre-proof
results in development of motor disabilities (183,184). Subcellular actions like production of
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of inflammatory responses and
transcriptional dysregulation play a part in the development of HD (185). Dysfunction of
cAMP/CREB signalling in HD is a result of overexpression of PDE4 (186). Interestingly, rolipram
is shown to increase the phosphorylation of CREB and BDNF and the survival rate, and also
improves the clinical signs in rodent model of HD (187). It has also been established that PDE4
inhibitors reduce cortical and striatal neuronal degeneration in transgenic mousfe model of HD
o
(188). Since, PDE4 inhibitors improve the cAMP and BDNF, and can regulate the neuronal
functions, they have been considered as potential drugs to treat HD. GlaxoSmithKline is
o
performing a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of rolipram in HD which is in Phase 1
r
(clinicaltrial.gov).

6.7. Stroke
e
Stroke is a neurodegenerative disease caused by sudden disruption of blood flow to a specific
region of the brain or the entire brain. Stroke caruses weakness, lack of sensation, paralysis, slurred
P
speech, aphasia, blurred vision (189). Disruption in the blood supply results in a series of metabolic
and molecular alterations which leads to neuronal damage (189,190). Approximately 80% of
strokes are ischemic while 20% arel haemorrhagic in nature (189). An ischemic stroke occurs when
a
blood to brain is blocked, while a haemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery ruptures in brain
(191). Gretarsdottir et nal. (2003) reported a decrease in stroke risk with PDE4 inhibition (12).
Several studies have elucidated the role of the PDE4 pathway in the pathogenesis of stroke (12,29).
r
Increased expuression of PDE4 in stroke plays a devastating role in mediating the neuronal cell
death (192). Decrease in cAMP leads to activation of immune responses, oedema and
o
hyperexcitability (12,29). Inhibition of cAMP-PDE4 reduces the infarct size in hippocampal
regJion of rats and gerbil (193,194). Rolipram restores endothelial function in stroke by regulating
vascular repair, inflammation and reduces the expression of tissue plasminogen which is connected
to increased cAMP concentration via Epac pathway (195). Rolipram increases hippocampal
neurogenesis and decreases ischemic injury in neuronal cultures (196). PDE4 inhibition prevents
blood brain barrier disruption, thrombosis, and reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and inhibits neuronal apoptosis in rat model of cerebral stroke (197).
Successive reports also conclude that the increased survival index, angiogenesis, and cognitive
16

Journal Pre-proof
performance are connected to improvement in cAMP/CREB levels with PDE4 inhibition (196).
More research works are being focused towards the reposition of PDE 4 inhibitors for its use in
cerebral stroke (Fig. 4).
6.8. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that causes loss of motor neurons in
the brain and spinal cord leading to atrophy of voluntary muscles (198). ALS afffects the motor
o
neurons of the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. About 90% of ALS cases are considered
sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) while 10% are familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
o
(fALS) (18). Yet the pathophysiology of ALS is not elucidated clearly. Nonetheless, aggregation
r
of intracellular toxins, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial
p
dysfunction are reported to be involved (198,199). TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) have been
-
identified to be involved in the progression of ALS. Mutations in TDP-43 have been found in
e
patients with ALS (200). Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway and production of neuroactive
metabolites is involved in the development ofr ALS (201). Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress
P
and NMDA excitotoxicity caused by the quinolinic acid produced during tryptophan metabolism
aggravates the progression of ALS (202). Ibudilast used for COPD is repurposed for ALS (203).
Ibudilast markedly enhances the cllearance of TDP-43 by promoting autolysosomes via mTORC1
a
inhibition in motor neurons (204) and also inhibits neuroinflammation and microglial activation
by increasing the cAMnP levels in neuron and microglia co-cultures (133). Ibudilast is also found
to reduce oxidative stress and increase the level of neurotrophic factors such as glia-derived
r
neurotrophic factor, NGF, NT-43 which supports the development and growth of neurons (133).
u
Preclinical studies have shown that Ibudilast protects hippocampal neurons, oligodendrocytes and
o
astrocytes from excitotoxicity and apoptosis. These effects were mediated by upregulation of
cGJMP/PKG signaling (142,205,206). Clinical trials (NCT02238626) are going on Ibudilast to
confirm its efficacy in ALS. In 2016, the European Medicines Agency recommended the use of
ibudilast for ALS (Fig. 5).
6.9. Glioma
PDEs are implicated in the development of various tumours. The role of cAMP on brain tumours
was established in 1977 when cAMP was discovered (207). Particularly, the role of cAMP on the
development of glioma is well studied in both in vitro and in vivo models (208–211). Warrington
17

## Page 19

Journal Pre-proof
et al (2015) found that overexpression of PDE4 increases glioma formation in Nf1 mice.
Overexpression of PDE4 is observed in medulloblastoma, glioblastoma (GBM),
oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, and meningioma (212) and the decreased adenylyl cyclase and
cAMP levels shown to inhibit apoptosis and enhance tumour growth (213). cAMP regulates
various physiological processes via cAMP/PKA or Epac1/Rap1-mediated pathways (214,215).
Rolipram is shown to exert cytotoxicity in A172 and U87MG human glioblastoma cell lines via
cAMP-dependent PKA and Epac1/Rap1-pathway (216,217). It induces apoptosis fin U87MG cells
o
through cAMP-dependent inhibition of AKT phosphorylation (218). Rolipram prevents the
development of tumour resistance and produces tumour regression in U87 glioblastoma and Daoy
o
medulloblastoma cells and xenograft model mice (219). It increases the life span in mice bearing
r
glioblastoma when administered along with temozolomide (212). Rolipram increases the
p
antitumor efficacy of bevacizumab in glioblastoma stem-like cells (GCSCs) by inhibiting
-
ERK/AKT signalling and inhibiting MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog) mediated p53
e
degradation. This in turn activates apoptosis and produces tumour cells death (220). Rolipram
suppresses tumor progression, and apoptosis inr xenograft brain tumour model by increasing the
P
levels of cAMP/CREB (221) and by inhibiting p27 (Cip1) and p21 (Kip1) cell cycle inhibitors
(232, 238). Rolipram is under investigation for its efficacy in patients with GBM.
l
6.10. Traumatic brain injury
a
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) imposes profound clinical problems such as disability, cognitive
n
deficits (223). TBI alters glucose metabolism, increases the production of free radicals and
r
mitochondrial dysfunction (224). TBI also increases the expression of PDE4 which results in
u
dysfunction of the cAMP-PKA pathway (29). PDE4B2 levels increase by 10-fold within one hour
o
after TBI. PDE4D2 is also highly expressed after TBI (225). A decrease in cAMP levels is
obJserved in the cortex and hippocampus within 15 minutes after TBI (29,226). A decrease in the
levels of cAMP triggers the release of proinflammatory mediators and affects LTP in the
hippocampus. This leads to cognitive decline in an experimental model of TBI (223). Rolipram
has been found to reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and IL-1β. These
are upregulated in microglial cells in EOC2 microglia cells and in rodent model of TBI (227,228).
Rolipram also improves cognitive function in cerebral ischemic rats and is reported to prevent
neuronal loss in the cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus by increasing the expression of
18

## Page 20

Journal Pre-proof
cAMP-PKA/CREB signalling cascade in TBI animals (229,230). It also reduces the deposition of
the beta-amyloid precursor protein in traumatic axonal injury (230). Since rolipram modulates
PDE4 isoforms and can effectively manage TBI symptoms, we suggest that PDE4 is a potential
target in the management of TBI.
6.11. Vascular dementia
Vascular dementia (VD) is an age-related neurodegenerative condition, responsible for at least
f
20% of dementia cases (231). Pathophysiologically, it is characterizedo by reduced cerebral
perfusion and causes mood disorders and attention and cognitive deficits (232). Multiple risk
o
factors including arterial hypotension, cerebrovascular diseases, cerebral haemorrhage and
r
infarcts causes VD (231). Furthermore, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and alterations in the
p
cyclic nucleotides levels are the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the progression of VD
(233,234). Inhibition of PDE4 results in the increase in cA-MP level and is reported to play a critical
e
role in regulating cerebral blood flow, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory (46,235).
Increased levels of cAMP are reported to dirlate pial vessels and potentially inhibit platelet
aggregation, which is correlated to impProved brain blood flow in feline cerebral ischemia (236).
Rolipram is shown to increase cortical blood flow measured via autoradiography in rats (237).
Similarly, administration of roflumilast increases the survival rate, memory and reduces white
l
a
matter injury in aged rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which corroborates to the increased
cAMP content (238). Betulinic acid, a naturally occurring PDE4 inhibitor is shown to improve the
n
cerebral blood flow measured by using the laser-Doppler flow meter in rats (260). Liang et al.
r
(2020) reported that α-mangostin, a natural PDE4 inhibitor, improves memory functions in beagle
u
dogs that are subjected to unilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Interestingly, treatment with
o
-mangostin does not cause emesis behaviour, as it selectively inhibits PDE4B (239).
CoJnvincingly, PDE4 inhibition improves blood flow to the brain by modulating blood vessels
function indirectly in VD.
6. Clinical trials on PDE4 inhibitors for neurological disorders
Clinical trials conducted so far have strengthened the therapeutic potential of PDE4 inhibitors in
the treatment of various neurological diseases like AD, PD, MS, HD, stroke, and depression. PDE4
are highly expressed in the brain and modulate a wide range of physiological processes by
19

## Page 21

Journal Pre-proof
modulating the intracellular secondary messengers cAMP and cGMP. In general, most of PDE4
inhibitors have better blood-brain barrier penetration property and hence, they have been focused
more to reposition in the treatment of brain related diseases (15). Rolipram, a cAMP specific PDE4
inhibitor, has been widely investigated in comparison to its counterparts (168). In 1992, a clinical
trial with rolipram showed potent antidepressant activity (240). However, it produced dose
dependent side effects like emesis, headache and increased gastric secretion (14). Inhibition of
PDE4D in the postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract is emetogenic causative fafctor of rolipram
o
(241). Another clinical trial was initiated by the National Institute of Health in 2006 to re-evaluate
the antidepressant activity of rolipram. It was found that rolipram inhibits both PDE4B and PDE4D
o
(which are prominently expressed in the brain) and has a potent antidepressant activity with less
r
side effects (178). PDE4 inhibitors under clinical trials for some neurological disorders are listed
p
in Table 2. The data is collected from ClinicalTrials.gov.
-
7. PDE4-isoform specific allosteric modulators ande their advantages
Inhibition of cAMP specific PDE4 enzymes is ra promising therapeutic option for airway diseases
treatment (19). Albeit, the first genePration PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast, rolipram,
apremilast, RS25344, PMNPQ, etc. have shown prominent therapeutic effect in preclinical and
clinical trials (242–245), the clinical acceptance is limited because of their side effects like nausea
l
a
and emesis, and gastric hypersecretion (246–248). These non-specific PDE4 inhibitors tightly bind
at the high affinity site (HPDE4) of the enzyme and lead to increase in the levels of cAMP, which
n
is responsible for the side effects (249). Cilomilast, a second generation PDE4 inhibitor binds at
r
the low affinity site (LPDE4) but still shows emesis (250). Thus, the first and second generation
u
PDE4 inhibitors are the non-specific inhibitors of all four subtypes (PDE4A, B, C, D) and increase
o
cAMP concentrations beyond the normal physiological need (251).
J
Studies in knockout mice have shown that PDE4D isoform is responsible for emesis and PDE4D-
deficient mice show an amplified sympathetic drive with decrease in sleeping time under
xylazine/ketamine–induced anaesthesia, a behavioural symptom that corresponds to emesis.
Further, PDE4D could potentially modulates the α -adrenoceptor, which causes emesis and other
2
side effects (252) and this warrants the need of development of specific PDE4 isoform inhibitors
in alleviating the above reported side effects (253). X-ray crystallography techniques have helped
in identifying the binding modes and the design of potent PDE4 isoform inhibitors (34). UCR2
20

## Page 22

Journal Pre-proof
specific allosteric modulators take advantage of an asymmetric PDE4 conformer by blocking only
one active site, without affecting the second active site. UCR2-directed PDE4D allosteric
modulators partially inhibit the cAMP hydrolysis and reduce emesis (251). D159687, a negative
allosteric modulator of PDE4D, enhances learning and memory in TBI rats (254). Furthermore, it
was also reported that D159687 does not induce emesis as predicted by the anaesthesia duration
test in mice (181). D159797 is a UCR2-directed allosteric modulator of PDE4D and shows better
performance in novel object recognition test with a 300 fold less emetic potentialf as compared to
o
rolipram in female Cynomolgus monkeys (255). Allosteric modulation provides a big ray of hope
in the clinical utility of PDE4 inhibitors in neurological disorders by improving synaptic plasticity
o
(254), increasing the spine density and upregulating the expression of neurotrophic factors such as
r
CREB, BDNF and VGF (256). Substantial research is underway to minimize the adverse effects
p
of PGE4Is and to obtain a therapeutic option that has better benefit-to-risk ratio. Approaches
-
towards the development of PDE4 isoform specific inhibitors with high binding affinity at the
e
catalytic site are expected to have reduced emesis, due to the reduced affinity at HPDE4 site 4,
whilst maintaining the potential therapeutic prorperties (257).
P
8. Conclusion
l
a
Dysregulation of cAMP signalling in brain is said to have strong connection with various
neurological disorders,n of which some have been found to be related to the increased expression
of PDE4 enzyme. Inhibition of PDE4 is shown to improve cAMP levels and offer neuroprotective
r
effects in AD, PD, HD, depression, MS, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders.
u
Many of the non-specific PDE4 inhibitors show neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of
o
neurological disorders, but unfortunately majority of them have failed in clinical trials. The first
anJd second generation PDE4 inhibitors are non-specific between other members of PDE4 families
and they produce a surge in cAMP levels beyond the physiological needs and this results in side
effect. Allosteric modulation on PDE4 isoform with specific inhibitors, particularly PDE4B and
PDE4D inhibitors have shown to possess required therapeutic properties and reduced side effect.
None-the-less, there is a need for extensive investigation on long-term toxicities,
pharmacokinetics, and data on biodistribution profiles for PDE4I. Also, the role of PDE4 subtype
specific inhibitors’ in neurological disorders largely and their ability to cross the blood brain
21

## Page 23

Journal Pre-proof
barrier needs investigation. Towards this end, the use of PDE4 subtype specific transgenic
knockout rodent models will provide clear information on the benefit-to-risk ratio. In conclusion,
PDE4 inhibition could be a worthwhile therapeutic option in the treatment of neurological
disorders and the development of new subtype specific inhibitors and their efficacy and toxicity at
preclinical and clinical levels needs to be investigated.

Fig. 3: 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) triggers the accumulation of reactive oxygen species
r
(ROS) and reduces mitochondrial membPrane potential (MMP) along with an increase in expression
of Bax and decrease in the level of Bcl-2. The levels of cleaved caspase 3 are also increased which
leads to neurodegeneration. MPP+ inhibits cAMP/PKA/CREB and Epac/Akt signalling pathway.
l
PDE4 inhibitors act by incraeasing the level of cAMP which activates cAMP/PKA/CREB and
Epac/Akt signalling pathways and prevents neurodegeneration.

Fig. 4: Activation of GPCR activates Gsα subunit and adenylyl cyclase (AC), which subsequently
catalyseos the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Increase in the level of local intracellular cAMP leads
to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac) which in
J
turn activates cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Under stroke conditions there
is an over expression of PDE4 in brain which decreases the cAMP levels which inhibits
PKA/CREB and Epac/ERK1/2 signalling. Activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB is critical for the
production of neurotrophic factors like BDNF while as Epac/ERK1/2 activation inhibits
proinflammatory factors. PDE4 inhibitors act by increasing the levels of cAMP/BDNF and thus
play a crucial role in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity
